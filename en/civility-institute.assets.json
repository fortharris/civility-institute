When you work hard all month, and your employer refuses to pay you at the end of the month, saying, you did no work, will you sense that you are being cheated?\n2. When you do not work all month and receive no reward at the end of the month, will you sense that you are being cheated?\n3. Do you draw the same *meaning* from the different ways you are treated?\n4. Give examples of different ways you can be treated and the meanings you may draw from them.\n5. Can different people draw different meanings from the *same* treatment?\n6. Give examples of how people may draw different meanings from the *same* treatment.\n7. If you came across a poor person and offered them money, what possible meanings can they draw from it?\n8. Is it possible for them to perceive it as a trick, that you will probably want something in return later on?\n9. Is it possible for them to perceive it as showing off to everyone that you have money?\n10. Is it possible for them to perceive it as you thinking that you can solve everyone's problem?\n11. Is it possible for them to perceive it also as an act of love?\n12. If you shared candies with a little child, would the child most likely perceive the treatment as love?\n13. Will they still perceive the treatment as love if you kept sharing candies with this child until eventually, they lose all their teeth?\n14. When they grow up and realize that they no longer have a perfect set of teeth, they cannot bite into most meals, and people are laughing at them, and you are the one to blame for it, will they continue to perceive your treatment as love?\n15. Is love a form of meaning drawn from a treatment from another person?\n16. Can a treatment that one person perceives as love, be perceived as another thing by another person?\n17. When you come across your child disrespecting an elderly person and you drag them into the house and scold them, what meaning will the child draw from your actions?\n18. Will the child perceive that you probably do not love them?\n19. When the child grows up to discover the benefit of treating adults with respect after your scolding has straightened them, how will they perceive your scolding?\n20. Will the child continue to perceive your treatment as hatred now that they are older?\n21. How will they perceive your scolding now that they are older and have started reaping the benefits of respecting adults?\n22.  What are some treatments that are always perceived as love, no matter who is receiving it?\n",

But something odd always happened when we got back home. After getting off the bus, we would often meet one of my aunts. This aunt liked to talk a lot and would stop my mom for a long chat. She talked about her problems at home, church, school, and other random stuff. My aunt did most of the talking while my mom, who seemed to forget I was there, just listened and added a few words now and then. I would get bored, tired of waiting, and walk the rest of the way home by myself.\n>\n> One day, when I was a bit older, I asked my mom why she always ignored me and talked with my aunt for so long when we came back from our trips. She smiled and explained something surprising. My mom told me that my aunt was married to a man who never talked to her. She kept a lot of things inside and only felt better when she talked to my mom. My mom wanted to show her love by giving my aunt all her attention and listening to her, no matter where they met – at church, on the road, or at home.\n>\n>Hearing this, I felt sorry for getting angry and walking away from them. I understood my aunt better and decided to visit her regularly and listen to all her stories, even if they seemed boring to me.\n2.

When you share a gift with your neighbor and experience the joy of sharing, are you more likely to share even more next time?\n2. Does love grow?\n3. Where do you sow the seed of love?\n4. How do you make your love grow?\n5. When you teach an individual, for free, is the individual also more likely to teach others for free?\n6. Can someone who does not love, on receiving love from you, consider showing love for others?\n7. Does love spread?\n8. When you wear a smile and wave at a child, how is the child most likely to respond?\n9. How do you make your love spread, even to the ends of the earth?\n10. When you have a neighbor who does not like you, and you minister love to them, are they likely to change their mind about you, and even change their attitude towards you?\n11. On learning that Christ was willing to live amongst men in order to teach them the ways of the Father, knowing that he will suffer horrible things and lose his own life, do you intend to live his message and be changed by it, or rather, reject it?\n12. Does love change the individual receiving the love?\n13. In what ways can love change the individual?\n14. In what ways can love change even the most unrepentant sinner?\n15. When you minister love to a wayward child, and your love never falters, is the child likely to reach a point in their lives where they begin to consider how their actions will affect you, and most likely make the right choices in order not to disappoint you?\n16. Would you like to disappoint your parents after all the love they have ministered to you?\n17. Would you like to disappoint your teachers after all that they have taught you?\n18. Would you like to disappoint the Father after all the love he has ministered to you?\n19. Does love serve as a guide and make us follow the right path?\n20. In what ways can love guide an individual, and help them to walk the right path?\n21. When you have given an individual a piece of yourself, does your word carry more weight with that individual, and makes them more likely to do what you tell them to do?\n22. Should we use love to help each other to grow, or rather, influence others to do the wrong things?\n",

If you believe in the word God has spoken to you, will anything be impossible to you? Matthew 17:20\n> He replied, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”\n26. What is the story of Jesus and the Rich Young Ruler? Matthew 19:16-22\n> 16 Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?”\n> \n> 17 “Why do you ask me about what is good?”  Jesus replied.  “There is only One who is good.

Each morning, you wake up earlier than you usually do and do a few things:\n\t- Sing a worship song to God. Singing worship songs has a way of transforming you from the inside, making you spiritually sensitive, and allowing you to feel God's presence in you.\n\t-  You say a prayer\n\t- Read a portion of scripture, vocally. You can start with the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) before reading Proverbs, Psalms, and the others.\n\t-  Meditate on what you have read and think about ways in which you can apply it. For instance, if Christ said that we shall be judged by every single word that we speak, I will start by repenting from every foul word I have ever spoken and be determined to speak only good words from now on.\n\t- God will begin to speak with you. Do as he says.\n\t- God loves consistency\n43. Should the child of God attempt to live by every word from God? Matthew 4:4\n> Matthew 4:4\n> 4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”\n>\n>Deuteronomy 8:3\n>3 So He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every _word_ that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord.\n44. Should the child of God attempt to live by every word from God, both written and unwritten?\n45. Have you received a word from God in the past?\n46. If yes then what are you waiting for?\n",

Matthew 8:5-10\n> 5 When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help.  6 “Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed,  suffering terribly.”\n>\n>7 Jesus said to him,  “Shall I come and heal him?”\n>\n>8 The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.  9 For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”\n>\n>10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him,  “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.\n3. Did the centurion believe quietly or vocally?\n4. How did the woman with the issue of bleeding receive healing from God through her faith? Matthew 9:20-22\n> 20 Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.  21 She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.”\n>\n>22 Jesus turned and saw her.  “Take heart,  daughter,”  he said,  “your faith has healed you.”  And the woman was healed at that moment.\n5. Did she believe quietly, or vocally?\n6. How did the blind receive their sight by exercising their faith? Matthew 9:28-30\n> 28 When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them,  “Do you believe that I am able to do this?”\n>\n>“Yes, Lord,” they replied.\n>\n>29 Then he touched their eyes and said,  “According to your faith let it be done to you”;  30 and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly,  “See that no one knows about this.”\n7. When you believe in your heart that God can do something and you say it aloud, will God do it if it's part of His plan? Matthew 8:13\n> 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.” And his servant was healed at that moment.\n8. If you say out loud, \"Heavenly Father, I believe you can make me completely healthy right now,\" and deep down you really believe it without any doubt, do you think He will make you healthy again?\n9. If you say out loud, \"Heavenly Father, I believe you can restore peace to my family,\" and deep down you really believe it without any doubt, do you think He will restore peace to your family?\n10. If you say out loud, \"Heavenly Father, I believe you can make all good things abound towards me,\" and deep down you really believe it without any doubt, do you think He will make all good things abound towards you?\n11. If your *mouth* says it and your *heart* agrees with it, will you have what you ask?\n12. How do you receive salvation by exercising your faith? Romans 10:8-9\n> 8 But what does it say?  “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart”  (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that  if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.\n13. How do you receive protection from God by exercising your faith? Psalm 91:9-13\n> 9 If you say, “The  Lord  is my refuge,”  \nand you make the Most High your dwelling,  \n10 no harm  will overtake you,  \nno disaster will come near your tent.  \n11 For he will command his angels  concerning you  \nto guard you in all your ways;  \n12 they will lift you up in their hands,  \nso that you will not strike your foot against a stone.  \n13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra;  \nyou will trample the great lion and the serpent.\n14. Say out loud 10 things that you believe your Heavenly Father can do for you, that you do not doubt in your heart He is able to do.\n15. >_“Heavenly Father, I believe that You are Jehovah Rapha, the Lord who heals me.

My household serves the Lord with joy. We walk in unity, love, and purpose. Every member of my family fulfills the divine destiny ordained by You.”_ (Isaiah 54:13, Joshua 24:15)\n24. >_“I speak blessing over my family. Love, forgiveness, and grace reign in our home. Our relationships are strong, our hearts are united, and the presence of God is at the center of all we do.”_ (Psalm 133:1, Colossians 3:13–14)\n25. >_“Heavenly Father, I trust You to direct my steps. I declare that I am led by Your Spirit and I walk in wisdom and discernment. You order my path and establish my plans as I commit all things into Your hands.”_ (Proverbs 3:5–6, Psalm 37:23)\n26. >_“I declare that I have the mind of Christ.

What causes the guilt in your conscience after you have offended someone?\n4. When you feel guilty, can you carry out your duties like before?\n5. When you are forgiven, what happens to your guilt? Isaiah 6:1-7\n> In the year that  King Uzziah died I  saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.  2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.  3 And one called to another and said:\n> \n> “Holy, holy, holy is the  Lord  of hosts;   the whole earth is full of his glory!”\n> \n> 4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.  5 And I said: “Woe is me!  For I am lost;  for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the  Lord  of hosts!”\n> \n> 6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.  7 And he  touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”\n6. When you refuse to forgive someone, are you holding them prisoner in your heart? Isaiah 58:6\n> “No, this is the kind of fasting I want: Free those who are wrongly imprisoned; lighten the burden of those who work for you. Let the oppressed go free, and remove the chains that bind people.\n7. When you forgive them, have you broken the chains that bind them?\n8. If you were about to start an adventure and someone told you that making even one mistake would be deadly, and you knew you weren't perfect and were bound to mess up, would you still go on the adventure?\n9. Can you become perfect at something without a second or multiple attempts?\n10. If you do not forgive the people who offend you, will they get another chance to do better? \n11. How does forgiving others help them to become perfect? \n12. When a person insults you for no reason at all, do you just stay silent and not mind them, or do you show them an act of love by saying \"Thank you!\" with a smile?\n13. Who forgives best, the one who does nothing when they are offended, or the one who responds with kindness? Luke 23:33-34\n> 33 When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left.  34 Jesus said,  “Father,  forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.\n14. What did Jesus mean by turning the other cheek? Matthew 5:39\n>39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.\n15. Is forgiveness needed in Heaven?\n16. What is the reason for your answer\n17. Is there someone that you have not forgiven?\n18. If yes, then what are you waiting for?\n",

We must become better in our thinking, speaking, and how we behave as time passes by. That is growth. Anything that does not grow is *dead*.\n2. When you are disrespectful today, tomorrow, and in the next ten(10) years, are you growing?\n3. When you keep using foul language, day after day, are you growing?\n4. When you did not know something yesterday, and now you have learned it, are you growing?\n5. Does the stone change and become better as the years go by?\n6. Is the stone living or dead?\n7. Are you living when you have become unchanging, like the stone?\n8. Am I growing or dying?\n> I used to be rude to people. One day, I decided I did not want to live like that anymore. I started being kind and gentle with my words, and now when people meet me they are delighted to speak with me.\n9. Has my mind expanded?\n> Yesterday, I did not know about growth, and now I do.\n10. How do you expand your mind?\n11. Has my personality expanded?\n> Yesterday, I would pray against my enemies. After studying scriptures, I have learned to pray for them, rather than pray against them. This morning, I prayed for my enemies.\n12. Is my personality expanding?\n> Weeks ago, I could not stand kids. I will walk right past them like they did not exist. Yesterday, I decided to begin to tolerate them and treat them like they actually matter. Now, I attempt to connect with every child I meet.\n13. How do you expand your personality?\n14. Can you say that you are neither growing nor dying?\n15. If you are not growing, are you dying?\n16. If you are either growing or dying, should you spend your time doing things that help you grow, or rather die?\n17. Should you listen to songs that do not help you to grow?\n18. Do the songs you listen to, help you to grow?\n19. Should you watch videos that do not help you to grow?\n20. Do the videos you watch, help you to grow?\n21. Should you have conversations that do not help you to grow?\n22. Do your conversations help you to grow?\n23. What are some things that you can start doing now, that will help you to grow?\n24.

Do you know the difference between right and wrong?\n4. Are you able to learn?\n5. Does the spirit of the Father live in you?\n6. When you grow to a stage where you now know the difference between right and wrong, good and bad, are you able to choose between right and wrong?\n7. Are you able to learn?\n8. Does the spirit of the Father come to live in you?\n9. Do you start taking steps with God?\n10. Why is every step that you take with God called a spirit victory? \n11. When you take steps with God until you become one with God, do you and the Father have the same will?\n12. Do you like the things that the Father likes?\n13. Do you dislike the things that the Father also dislikes?\n14. Do you and God think, speak, and act alike?\n15. What did Christ say about himself and the Father when he reached this stage?\n16. Are you now under *grace*?\n17. Will you willfully disobey the Father?\n18. Do you receive anything that you ask the Father?\n19. Why do you receive anything that you ask the Father?\n20. When you learn from your teacher, do you set questions for yourself, answer the questions, and then tell yourself that you have passed?\n21. How would you know that you and the Father have now become one?\n22. Will you have any doubts that you are truly a child of the Father when the Father confirms you himself?\n23. Do you want the Father to confirm you, or do you want other humans to confirm you?\n24. When your spirit is mature, are you able to ascend into the Heavens without first sleeping?\n25. When your spirit is mature, are you able to grow to old age because God needs you around to put the good in you into others, you sleep, and then you ascend into the Heavens\n26. Which individuals were translated into Heaven without first sleeping?\n27. What happens to the spirit of the Father in you, when you fail to ascend?\n28. If a reason must be given on behalf of each individual who fails to ascend, why they failed to ascend, should we do what we can to help each other to grow, or rather, discourage them?\n29. What are some things that you can do to help other people to grow, and be able to ascend?\n30. Which stage are you in now?\n31. How do you get to the next stage?\n\n",

Genesis 1:16\n> God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.\n2. Whom did God appoint to rule over the night?\n3. Does the moon have a light of its own, or does the moon only reflect the light of the sun?\n4. Does the day and night already have their ruler?\n5. What are the two kingdoms of this world? Matthew 12:26-30\n> 26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?\n6. How many kingdoms will attempt to civilize you when you are born into the world?\n7. How many governments will attempt to rule over your life when you are born into the world?\n8. Who rules over the Kingdom of Light?\n9. Does the Kingdom of Light live by a different set of rules, and does it have its own way of dressing, music, movies, language, marriage, etc.? Matthew 6:33\n> But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. \n10. Does the Kingdom of God have it's right way of doing things?\n11. Must the believer seek this right way of doing things and attempt to live by them?\n12. Describe music in the Kingdom of Light.\n13. Describe dressing in the Kingdom of Light.\n14. Who rules over the Kingdom of Darkness?\n15. Does the Kingdom of Darkness live by a different set of rules, and does it have its way of dressing, music, movies, language, marriage, etc.?\n16. Describe music in the Kingdom of Darkness.\n17. Describe dressing in the Kingdom of Darkness.\n18. Describe sex in both kingdoms.\n19. In what ways does the language of the Kingdom of Darkness differ from the Kingdom of Light?\n20. Is *fornication and adultery* in the Kingdom of Light called *cheating* in the Kingdom of Darkness?\n21. Does the Kingdom of Light practice _courtship_ before marriage, wheras the Kingdom of Darkness practices _dating_, which involves sampling other humans, before marriage?\n22.  Is _dating_ beneath a person who has been civilized by God?\n23. What is the source of your civilization?\n24. When you enter the Kingdom of Light who becomes your ruler?\n25. How do you enter the Kingdom of Light? John 3:3\n> Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.”\n18.. When you enter the Kingdom of Darkness who becomes your ruler?\n26. How do you enter the Kingdom of Darkness?\n27. Can you belong to both kingdoms at the same time?\n28. Who do you wish to be your ruler?\n29. Which kingdom do you wish to belong to?\n30. What is the story of Samson?\n31. Which kingdom did Samson belong to at his birth?\n32. What was God's purpose for sending Samson into the world? Judges 13:5\n> 5 You will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor because the boy is to be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from the womb. He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines.\n33. List the ways the Kingdom of Darkness treated Samson after he discovered the Spirit had left him, in the order in which they happened. Judges 16:21\n> 21 Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza.  Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison. \n34. How do you suppose they took out his eyes?\n35. How will you be treated like Samson when you step out of the light into the Kingdom of Darkness?\n36. Will you be bound?\n37. Will your vision and purpose for life be taken from you?\n38. Will your strengths and talents be wasted and used for the benefit of the Kingdom of Darkness?\n39. Will you be harmed in a way that will make it difficult for you to return to the light, and even if you did, you will be useless in the hands of God? \n40. Will the Kingdom of Darkness use you for entertainment? Judges 16:25\n> And when their hearts were merry, they said, “Call Samson, that he may entertain us.” So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars.\n41. Are there humans bound by unclean spirits, because they did not stay in the light and remain holy? Matthew 12:43-45\n> 43 “When an evil spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none.  44 Then it says, ‘I will return to the person I came from.’ So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order.  45 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation.”\n42. Are those humans tormented day and night?\n43. Does God brag about his children to his enemies? Job 1:8\n> Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? No one else on earth is like him. He is an honest man and innocent of any wrong. He honors God and stays away from evil.”\n44. Will you be used to mock God and bring dishonor to his name? Judges 16:23\n> Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice, and they said, “Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand.”\n45. Do you want God to be mocked because you refused to stay in the light?\n46. Is the story of Samson about the betrayal of a woman, or is the story about what happens to a child of the light when they decide to experiment with darkness?\n47. Did Samson's fall start as a joke to him? Judges 16:10-12\n> 10 Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have made a fool of me;  you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied.”\n>\n>11 He said, “If anyone ties me securely with new ropes  that have never been used, I’ll become as weak as any other man.”\n>\n>12 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!”  But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.\n48. Did Samson know that his bronze shackles had already been prepared?\n49. Is it for your safety that God instructs you to separate yourself from the Kingdom of Darkness and be holy?\n50. Repent from anything you have taken from the Kingdom of Darkness and ask God to take you back and sanctify you.\n",

Can God put a lot of potential in a person that is not immediately noticeable at their birth? Jeremiah 1:5\n> Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born  I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\n11. What do you have to do to grow?\n12. If you are the seed, then who are the weeds?\n13. What do you do about the people who try to prevent you from growing?\n14.

Revelation 12:3-4\n> 3 Another mysterious sight appeared in the sky. There was a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and a crown on each of his heads. 4 With his tail he dragged a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth. He stood in front of the woman, in order to eat her child as soon as it was born.\n22. Can you easily be destroyed when you are little or when you are an adult?\n23.

What does God expect from every man?\n4. Is it possible to become perfect?\n5. Is it possible to become like God?\n6. What does it mean to be perfect?\n7. Are you perfect when you are not respectful?\n8. Are you perfect when you are not kind?\n9. If you wish to become like someone, what do you have to do?\n10. How does a man become perfect like God?\n11. Read **Psalm 82** twice.\n> 1 God presides in the great assembly;  \nhe renders judgment  among the “gods”:\n>\n> 2 “How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked? \n> 3 Defend the weak and the fatherless;  uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.   \n> 4 Rescue the weak and the needy;   deliver them from the hand of the wicked.\n> \n> 5 “The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness;   all the foundations of the earth are shaken.\n> \n> 6 “I said, ‘You are “gods”;   you are all sons of the Most High.’   \n> 7 But you will die  like mere mortals;   you will fall like every other ruler.”\n> \n> 8 Rise up,  O God, judge the earth,   for all the nations are your inheritance.\n12. What is judgment?\n13. Which people have gathered?\n14. Who is leading the gathering?\n15. In verse 2, what are the gods doing wrong?\n16. What does God expect from the gods in verse 3?\n17. What does God expect from the gods in verse 4?\n18. Who is the Most High in verse 6?\n19. Why does God have to remind the gods that \"I said, ‘You are “gods”; you are all sons of the Most High?\"\n20. Read  **John 10:30-36**.\n> 30 I and the Father are one.”\n> \n> 31 Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him,  32 but Jesus said to them,  “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?”\n> \n> 33 “We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.”\n> \n> 34 Jesus answered them,  “Is it not written in your Law,  ‘I have said you are “gods”’?  35 If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—  36 what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world?  Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?\n21. In verse 33, why did the Jews try to stone Jesus?\n22. What is blasphemy?\n23. In verse 34, which part of the bible was Jesus referring to?\n24. In verse 35, who are the gods?\n25. Read  Psalm 82 again\n26. In verse 5, Why does God say that \"The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing...?\"\n27. Do the gods know that they are gods?\n28. Do the gods know that they are all sons of the Most High, and can become like God?\n29. What happens to you when you walk in a place without light?\n30. When do we say that a person is living in darkness?\n31. In verse 5, why does God say that the gods walk about in darkness?\n32. Is the earth a school?\n33. What is the purpose of a school?\n34. What are the gods supposed to learn before they leave the earth?\n35. When a person walks into a school and comes out worse than they entered it, is the school serving its purpose?\n36. When all the people who walk into a school, come out worse than they entered it, and bad has now become good, is the school serving its purpose?\n37. Why does God say that the earth has gone out of course?\n38. Even though men are children of the Most High, what will happen to them if they do not conduct themselves like sons of God?\n39. Did the Jews understand Psalm 82 at the time of Jesus?\n40. Do the people around you know and understand Psalm 82?\n41. What are you going to do about it?\n42. Read **Numbers 18:20**.\n>  20 The Lord said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites.\n43. *The children of Israel had settled down and divided the lands among themselves. Aaron asks God what his share will be and God tells him that He, God, will be his share and inheritance.*\n44. How does God become your share and your portion?\n45. When you become like God, can you also do the things that God can do?\n46. Do you want God or the things that God has created?\n47. How do you inherit someone?\n48. How do you inherit God, who will not die?\n49. Who received the greatest gift among the children of Israel?\n \n\n\n",

                    "markdown": "# In a Nutshell\nChrist in a Nutshell\n\nTo really get who Christ is, you need to understand the Trinity. John explains it best in John 1.\n\nIn the Old Testament, people only knew about God, but it turns out there are multiple spirit personalities that are also God. Christ is one of them, and He’s actually the creator of the world and everything in it.\n\nGod doesn't exist; He is, and He brings everything into existence. Christ has always existed, even before He came to earth. This confused a lot of people who thought they knew all about His birth and family. John 8:48-59.\n\nChrist didn’t want people to recognize Him just by His words but wanted them to figure it out through His actions and understanding of the scriptures.\n\nChrist had the power to forgive sins and had been doing so long before His crucifixion. Luke 5:24.\n\nThe whole idea of atonement tries to make sense of His brutal death on the cross. Even so, He told the Jews not to weep for Him as He was about to be crucified because He knew that what would happen to them after His death and resurrection would be worse than dying on the cross. Luke 23:27-28.\n\nBefore His death, Christ said many things that were hard for people to accept. John 11:20-26. He didn’t just have the power to bring people back to life; He is the resurrection. This means that if you become like Christ by following Him through the Holy Spirit, you’ll be like a balloon that won’t sink in water. Even if you get pushed down, you’ll rise again. You’ll never really die; if you’re killed, you’ll come back to life.\n\nMany people thought Christ was possessed, called Him a Samaritan, a madman, and didn’t take Him seriously. He knew that for people to believe, He had to show them a sign. Matthew 12:38-42.\n\nWhen it was time for Him to be crucified, His enemies, including the devil, thought they could humiliate Him. But they didn’t know that the Father planned to use this to glorify the Son and spread His message. Stay with me here.\n\nIf Christ hadn’t died publicly, His resurrection wouldn’t have meant much to anyone. His public humiliation, death on the cross, burial, and resurrection on the third day made it clear to everyone that Christ, the carpenter’s son, was telling the truth. This shook the devil and convinced people who were unsure about His teachings. This is what made Christ's message spread and take root in people’s hearts to the point where they were willing to die for it. Even His disciples didn’t believe it at first and needed proof, like seeing the marks on His palms.\n\nChrist is the key to the Father’s house. He is the way, the truth, and the life. Become like Christ, and you will live. Through Him, more people can become like Christ, and then they can ascend. The Holy Spirit is here to help with that. You can’t live a Christian life without the Holy Spirit. To be like Christ is to have Christ. I can’t stress this enough. Believing in the Son of God means acting on His every word, not just saying you believe. That’s how you become.\n\nThe path is narrow because many people try to find their own way into God’s kingdom without changing themselves.\n\nMatthew 5:48. The only way to become like God is to imitate Him. There’s no other way. Christ is our role model and standard. After taking on human nature, He can now help humans overcome their limitations and reach the Father’s mark of perfection.\n",

No one _is_ good but One, _that is,_ God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”\n>\n> 18 He said to Him, “Which ones?”\n>\n> Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ 19 ‘Honor your father and _your_ mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”\n>\n> 20 The young man said to Him, “All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?”\n>\n> 21 Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”\n>\n> 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.\n\nThe rich young ruler must follow three steps:\n- Follow all the commandments\n- Give all that he has to the poor\n- Follow Christ (for it is by following and imitating God that a man becomes like God)\n",

When a person sins or commits evil and God has already judged them, is there a need for other humans to also judge them again, or rather, cure them?\n11. When a person starts sinning, does God punish them immediately, or warn them first? \n12. Should humans also attempt to guide other humans to repentance? Ezekiel 3:18\n> When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.\n13. When a person does something wrong and is later found to have committed evil, what does God expect other humans to do? \n14.

What can you do to cure such a person?\n30. Did you commit sin or evil?\n> Your friend informs you that her mother beats her in the house every day. You go to her house to talk to the mother with the hope that her mother might stop beating her. Her mother rather gets angry and starts beating her even more. \n31. What might be a possible cure to prevent you from making the same mistake again?\n32. Did the man commit sin or evil?\n> A man wants to build a house. He first has to clear the land so he cuts down a few trees that are growing on the land. After building the house he falls sick and prays to God.

These powers will try to distract you, discourage you, or convince you that these lessons are not meant for you. Resist the urge to dismiss them—stay focused and remain open, even if they don’t seem to apply to you right now. Ephesians 6:12\n> For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\n2. Pray vocally:\n> Heavenly Father,  \nI come before You in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, the Light of the world. Lord, I confess that at times I have walked in darkness, confusion, or ignorance of Your truth. I repent of every sin, disobedience, and compromise that has given the enemy access to cloud my vision.\n>\n>Father, Your Word says that the god of this world blinds the minds of unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel (2 Corinthians 4:4). Today, I renounce every veil of darkness, deception, doubt, and spiritual blindness in my life. Let every scale fall from my eyes as You opened the eyes of Saul on the Damascus road.\n>\n>Lord Jesus,\nShine Your light into every hidden corner of my soul. Expose lies I have believed, destroy false mindsets, and release the Spirit of truth into my heart. I declare that I will no longer stumble in darkness but will walk in the light as You are in the light.\n>\n>Holy Spirit,\nAnoint my eyes with spiritual sight. Give me discernment to recognize what is from You and what is not. Teach me to see myself, others, and every situation through the lens of Your Word.\n>\n>From today, I break free from confusion, deception, and spiritual blindness. I receive clarity, wisdom, and revelation in the name of Jesus. My steps are ordered by the Lord, and I will walk in His light all the days of my life.\n>\n>Thank You, Father, for opening my eyes.\nIn Jesus’ name, Amen.\n3. What do you observe? Matthew 12:22-29\n> 22 Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.  23 All the people were astonished and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”\n> \n> 24 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul,  the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.”\n> \n> 25 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them,  “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.  26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?  27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul,  by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.  28 But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\n> \n> 29 “Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.\n4. In verse 22, what was the man suffering from because he had demons living in him?\n5. Can demons make a man blind and mute?\n6.

So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.”\n> \n> 15 The Lord answered him,  “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?  16 Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham,  whom Satan  has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?”\n20.

Cleanse me with Your fire. Restore what the enemy tried to steal. Replace every lie with Your truth, and give me a hunger for Your Word and Your presence.\n>\n>I declare that I am a child of God.

For many false prophets have gone out everywhere. 2 This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit: anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God. 3 But anyone who denies this about Jesus does not have the Spirit from God.

If it is not from You, I ask You to expose it and drive it away from me. I stand on Your Word, which says to test every spirit, and I trust You to protect me with Your truth.\n>\n>Let no deception take root in my heart, and let me walk only in the path of righteousness and truth. In Jesus’ name I pray,  Amen.\n72. Pray and ask God to give you the spirit of discernment to be able to tell the difference between spirits.\n73.

Matthew 27:20-25\n> 20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.\n>\n>21 “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor.\n>\n>“Barabbas,” they answered.\n>\n>22 “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?”  Pilate asked.\n>\n>They all answered, “Crucify him!”\n>\n>23 “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.\n>\n>But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”\n>\n>24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar  was starting, he took water and washed his hands  in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,”  he said. “It is your responsibility!”\n>\n>25 All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”\n74.

I stand upon the truth of Your Word in Isaiah 49:24–26, which declares that even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered.\n>\n>Lord, I acknowledge that no power in heaven, on earth, or under the earth is greater than You. You are the God who breaks chains, sets the oppressed free, and defends the cause of the afflicted.\n>\n>Today, I lift up every area of bondage in my life—every spiritual captivity, every stronghold, every oppression of the enemy. Whether from the hand of the mighty or the grip of the terrible, I declare that I am delivered in the name of Jesus.\n>\n>Father, You promised:\n>\n> _“I will contend with those who contend with you, and I will save your children.”_\n>\n>So now, O Lord, rise up and contend with every force that contends with me—every demonic influence, every generational curse, every lie of the enemy. Let Your mighty arm be revealed. Let Your vengeance be seen upon every spiritual adversary, and let them know that You, the Lord, are my Savior and my Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.\n>\n>I declare and decree that the captives are being released, the oppressed are going free, and the prey of the ruthless is being rescued. I claim freedom in my mind, peace in my soul, and healing in my body.\n>\n>Father, let all who war against me be confounded.\nLet every plan of darkness be reversed.  \nLet the blood of Jesus silence every accusation and break every chain.\n>\n>Thank You, Lord, for Your covenant promise of deliverance. I trust in You, and I stand in victory today, knowing that You have spoken, and You will perform it.\n>\n>In Jesus’ mighty name, I pray. Amen.\n",

Genesis 6:1-8\n> 6 When people had spread all over the world, and daughters were being born, 2 some of the heavenly beings saw that these young women were beautiful, so they took the ones they liked. 3 Then the  Lord said, “I will not allow people to live forever; they are mortal. From now on they will live no longer than 120 years.” 4 In those days, and even later, there were giants on the earth who were descendants of human women and the heavenly beings. They were the great heroes and famous men of long ago.\n> \n> 5 When the  Lord saw how wicked everyone on earth was and how evil their thoughts were all the time, 6 he was sorry that he had ever made them and put them on the earth. He was so filled with regret 7 that he said, “I will wipe out these people I have created, and also the animals and the birds, because I am sorry that I made any of them.” 8 But the  Lord was pleased with Noah.\n2.

When will evil spirits be completely wiped out from the earth?\n14. Until the great judgment, will evil spirits continue to fight the children of God?\n15. Was hell made for these fallen spirits and their children or humans? Matthew 25:41\n>41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\n16. Do evil spirits work with the devil to fight the children of God?\n17. Who is the head of the family of evil spirits? Matthew 10:23-26\n> 23 When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another.

I believe that You formed me with purpose, and that Your plans for me are to prosper me and not to harm me—to give me a future and a hope (_Jeremiah 29:11_).\n>\n>Lord, I repent for every sin, known and unknown, in my life or in my bloodline that has opened the door to captivity or delay. I plead the blood of Jesus over my soul, my destiny, and every area of my life.\n28. *Father, in the name of Jesus, I call forth my soul from every spiritual prison.*\n> “Return to your rest, O my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.”_ (Psalm 116:7)\n29. *I call forth my destiny from every demonic altar, coven, or place of delay.*\n> “Oh Lord, You are my portion and my inheritance; You hold my lot.

I take back what the enemy has stolen.*\n> “When the thief is found, he must restore sevenfold.” (Proverbs 6:31)\n34. *I declare: My life is back in alignment with Heaven.*\n> My soul is restored, my mind renewed, my purpose awakened, and my blessings loosed!\n35. Declare boldly:\n> Father, I receive the keys of David that open what no one can shut.  \nI walk into my divine appointments, open doors, healthy relationships, and favor from heaven and earth.  \nLet every delay turn into divine acceleration. Let every curse be turned into a blessing.  \nLet every spiritual blockage now become a breakthrough.  \nLet every dry place become an oasis.\n>\n>I declare boldly:\n>_\"O my destiny, arise and shine! My soul shall not be caged. My purpose shall not be aborted. My season of restoration is here.\"_  \nIn the mighty name of Jesus Christ, I pray.  \nAmen.\n\n",

Did David and Goliath's fight start *spiritually* or *physically*? 1 Samuel 17:41-45\n> 41 Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David.  42 He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome,  and he despised him.  43 He said to David, “Am I a dog,  that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  44 “Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the birds  and the wild animals!”\n>\n>45 David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin,  but I come against you in the name of the  Lord  Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.\n63.

Take up shield and armor; arise and come to my aid.”_ (Psalm 35:1-2)  \n\t> _“Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.”_ (Psalm 91:1)\n\t>\n\t>I dwell under Your shadow. I am safe. Every plan of darkness is nullified, and Your divine light surrounds me.  \n\tAmen.\n71. Witchcraft in Action:\n> Witchcraft is about dominating other people—controlling them and making them do things they would never do in their right minds. You must understand that Satan is the originator of this behavior. It’s a craft—something that’s learned—and there’s always a spirit backing it.\n>\n>Let me give you a scenario. You attend prayer meetings regularly at your church. Then one day, a woman starts coming to those meetings. She claims she's afflicted by evil spirits and needs deliverance, so naturally, you feel compassion. She draws close to you and begins whispering in your ear that she has a prophetic gift. She tells you that most people in the church are filled with demons or have some hidden evil in them. You begin to listen, and slowly, both of you stop going to the prayer meetings. Eventually, you start pulling away from the church altogether.\n>\n>Around the same time, your father has a sore on his leg that just won’t heal. Then your mother travels for three days. During her absence, the same woman comes to your house and offers some kind of medicine for your father’s sore—and it works. You're impressed by her spiritual abilities, and so is your father. She then tells both of you that your mother—the very woman who raised you—is actually the cause of the sore that wouldn’t heal.\n>\n>When your mother returns home, you and your father treat her with suspicion and hostility. Suddenly, things begin to “make sense” to you. You remember how she sometimes acted strangely, especially when you were fasting. You start blaming her for your struggles in life—why you couldn’t finish school, why nothing seems to work for you. One day, you go so far as to drag her out of the house and slap her.\n>\n>And this isn’t like you at all. You were once a strong believer, even preparing to become a pastor or preacher, though academics were never your strong suit.\n>\n>Your mother is kicked out of the house and goes to live with your older sister. Meanwhile, the woman moves in with her eight children—after leaving her own husband—and eventually becomes pregnant by you.\n>\n>You now believe you're a junior prophet and she is the senior prophet. Together, you begin praying for and “healing” people. When someone visits you and you step outside to talk, you find yourself telling them that the woman will reveal everything you’ve just said once you go back inside. You even feel something pressing against your skull while you're speaking.\n>\n>To cut a long story short: your father’s sore comes back. His leg is amputated, and eventually, he dies. The baby you have with the woman doesn’t survive. Then you leave town with her and her children to live in a distant community. Your mother still mourns those three days she traveled, saying if she had known what would unfold, she would never have gone.\n",

You must understand that Satan is the originator of this behavior. It’s a craft—something that’s learned—and there’s always a spirit backing it.\n>\n>Let me give you a scenario. You attend prayer meetings regularly at your church. Then one day, a woman starts coming to those meetings. She claims she's afflicted by evil spirits and needs deliverance, so naturally, you feel compassion. She draws close to you and begins whispering in your ear that she has a prophetic gift. She tells you that most people in the church are filled with demons or have some hidden evil in them. You begin to listen, and slowly, both of you stop going to the prayer meetings. Eventually, you start pulling away from the church altogether.\n>\n>Around the same time, your father has a sore on his leg that just won’t heal. Then your mother travels for three days. During her absence, the same woman comes to your house and offers some kind of medicine for your father’s sore—and it works. You're impressed by her spiritual abilities, and so is your father. She then tells both of you that your mother—the very woman who raised you—is actually the cause of the sore that wouldn’t heal.\n>\n>When your mother returns home, you and your father treat her with suspicion and hostility. Suddenly, things begin to “make sense” to you. You remember how she sometimes acted strangely, especially when you were fasting. You start blaming her for your struggles in life—why you couldn’t finish school, why nothing seems to work for you. One day, you go so far as to drag her out of the house and slap her.\n>\n>And this isn’t like you at all. You were once a strong believer, even preparing to become a pastor or preacher, though academics were never your strong suit.\n>\n>Your mother is kicked out of the house and goes to live with your older sister. Meanwhile, the woman moves in with her eight children—after leaving her own husband—and eventually becomes pregnant by you.\n>\n>You now believe you're a junior prophet and she is the senior prophet. Together, you begin praying for and “healing” people. When someone visits you and you step outside to talk, you find yourself telling them that the woman will reveal everything you’ve just said once you go back inside. You even feel something pressing against your skull while you're speaking.\n>\n>To cut a long story short: your father’s sore comes back. His leg is amputated, and eventually, he dies. The baby you have with the woman doesn’t survive. Then you leave town with her and her children to live in a distant community. Your mother still mourns those three days she traveled, saying if she had known what would unfold, she would never have gone."

                    "markdown": "# Breaking Addictions\n\nAddiction is one of the enemy's most effective strategies to keep God's children in bondage. The Bible identifies three major snares: _the lust of the flesh_, _the lust of the eyes_, and _the pride of life_. These are the pathways through which many fall into captivity.\n\nAt a certain point, addiction moves beyond the physical and psychological—it becomes spiritual. A demonic presence enters and binds the individual, trapping them in a cycle of guilt, repentance, and repeated failure. You find yourself despising what you do, yet returning to it time and again. This inner conflict stems from the pure spirit within you resisting the darkness you’ve allowed in. Jesus refers to this demonic force as _the strongman_.\n\n> Mark 3:27\n> _\"In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man’s house.\"_\n\nBut there is good news: Christ has given every believer real authority over the powers of darkness.\n\n> Luke 10:19\n> _\"I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.\"_\n\n> Mark 16:17-18 \n> _“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;  \n> They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”_\n\nNotice: _the believer_, not God, casts out devils. God has given _you_ authority in the name of Jesus. It is now your responsibility to use that authority.\n\nSpeak boldly and pray with faith:\n\n> _“In the name of Jesus, I command every spirit of lust, pornography, masturbation,[insert sin] to leave me now and never return.”_\n\n> _“In the name of Jesus, I command every spirit behind my addiction to pornography, masturbation, [insert sin] to leave me now and never return.”_\n\nThen consecrate yourself to God daily:\n\n> _“Heavenly Father, I give You my heart, my mind, my body, and my soul. Let them be Yours today and always, in the name of Jesus.”_\n\nLet this be your daily declaration and commitment. Remember, freedom is not just possible—it’s promised for those who believe and act on the Word.\n\n**Porn, Masturbation:**\nThere are spiritual forces that operate like soul ties, bonding themselves to individuals through sexual sin. Some describe them as demons that “marry” a person in the spirit, obsessively working to isolate them from real, godly relationships. These forces can plant thoughts and desires—especially for porn and masturbation—while manifesting as sexual dreams. They use these to keep you bound, distracted, and disconnected from your purpose.\n\nTheir goal? To destroy your ability to form healthy, lasting relationships. They can sabotage romantic prospects, disrupt your marriage, and even cause division in your family line. Many experience spiritual stagnation, financial hardship, and a weakened relationship with God as a result. It’s a cycle of spiritual oppression masked as pleasure and “harmless” indulgence.\n\nIf you’re serious about your spiritual growth and future, learn to hate what keeps you bound. Porn isn't a release—it’s a chain.\n\nVocally pray with faith:\n> Heavenly Father,  \nI come before You today with a broken and contrite heart. I confess my sin of giving in to lust, pornography, and masturbation. I have allowed my eyes, heart, and body to be defiled by things that do not glorify You. I have opened doors that should have remained shut, and I have grieved Your Holy Spirit.\n>\n>Lord, Your Word says in 1 John 1:9 that _\"if we confess our sins, You are faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\"_ I bring my sin before You now—not hiding, not excusing, not minimizing—but laying it all at Your feet in repentance. Cleanse me, O God.\n>\n>I renounce every agreement I have made with the spirit of lust. I break every soul tie, mental image, and spiritual bond I’ve formed through pornography and impurity. Let every demonic foothold in my life be broken by the power of the blood of Jesus.\n>\n>Jesus, Your blood was shed not only to forgive me but to set me free. According to Romans 6:14, sin shall no longer have dominion over me. I declare that I am not a slave to these habits. I am not bound to shame, guilt, or condemnation. I am a new creation in Christ—old things have passed away, behold, all things have become new.\n>\n>Renew my mind, Lord. Teach me to guard my eyes, my heart, and my thoughts. Teach me to flee temptation. Fill every empty space with Your presence, Your truth, and Your love. Replace lust with purity, addiction with discipline, and shame with grace.\n>\n>Holy Spirit, I invite You into every part of my life. Convict me quickly, strengthen me daily, and guide me always. Surround me with godly accountability and help me walk in the light.\n>\n>Thank You, Father, for never giving up on me. Thank You, Jesus, for Your mercy. Thank You, Holy Spirit, for empowering me to live holy.\n>\n>In Jesus’ name,  \nAmen.\n",

                    "markdown": "# Breaking Altars\n\nAltars—both physical and spiritual—are powerful spiritual systems of covenant and sacrifice. In families, demonic altars are often erected by ancestors or individuals through rituals, sacrifices, or agreements with dark powers. These altars serve as platforms through which demonic spirits operate, and they can destroy individuals and entire family lines if not broken.\n\nHere’s how altars are used in families to destroy people and destinies:\n\n**1. Altars Establish Evil Covenants**\n\nAn altar is where covenants are made. When someone in your lineage makes a pact with spirits—whether for protection, wealth, fertility, or power—they often raise an altar (knowingly or unknowingly). That altar becomes a legal ground for demons to operate across generations, binding descendants to the original agreement.\n\n-   **Example**: A grandfather dedicates the family to a shrine for wealth. Generations after him suffer cycles of sudden death, barrenness, or madness because the demonic covenant was never broken.\n\n**2. Altars Demand Sacrifices (Including Lives)**\n\nDemonic altars often require regular sacrifices—blood, suffering, or acts of sin. When those demands aren’t met, the spirits behind the altar attack family members to extract it.\n\n-   **Signs**: Repeated miscarriages, premature deaths, accidents at the same age, poverty, and mental illness.\n\n**3. Altars Enforce Evil Patterns**\n\nFamily altars are responsible for recurring negative patterns—cycles that repeat in each generation despite efforts to break free.\n\n-   **Examples**:\n    -   No one gets married or stays married.\n    -   Men die before 50.\n    -   No one rises above a certain level financially or academically.\n    -   Alcoholism or sexual perversion follows the bloodline.\n\nThese are spiritual systems programmed through altars.\n\n**4. Altars Imprison Destinies**\n\nAltars can be used to capture and delay destinies. They spiritually bind a person's purpose and gifts, making them ineffective or hidden. A person may have potential, but never realize it due to an altar speaking limitation.\n\n-   **Examples**: Someone with high intellect but always fails exams. A gifted singer never gets an opportunity. A visionary always meets closed doors.\n\n**5. Altars Attract Familiar Spirits**\n\nAltars become access points for familiar spirits—demons assigned to monitor and manipulate family members. These spirits know your patterns, weaknesses, and history, and they work to maintain bondage.\n\n-   They influence choices, relationships, dreams, and even emotions, keeping people under the influence of the altar.\n\n**6. Altars Accuse and Block Prayers**\n\nAltars serve as legal grounds for accusation in the spirit realm. They can block prayers, hinder deliverance, or delay blessings because of unresolved ancestral covenants.\n\n-   **Revelation 12:10** speaks of the \"accuser of the brethren.\" Altars often function through demonic accusation.\n\n**7. Altars are Reinforced through Family Practices**\n\nFamily traditions (e.g., idol worship, ancestral festivals, pouring libations, certain names) can renew and reinforce the power of the altar unknowingly.\n\n-   Participating in these seemingly harmless rituals can reactivate dormant altars.\n\n**8. Altars Operate Through Bloodlines**\n\nEven if you never participated, you can be affected if you’re part of the bloodline tied to the altar. This is why people suffer from things they can’t trace, because of bloodline covenants.\n\n**How to Break Free**\n\n-   Repentance & Renunciation (1 John 1:9)\n-   Blood of Jesus (Hebrews 12:24)\n-   Deliverance Prayers & Fasting (Mark 9:29)\n-   Holy Communion – to spiritually disconnect from evil altars\n-   Raising a godly altar – worship, prayer, sacrifice unto God (Genesis 12:7)\n\n### **Prayer to Break Generational Altars and Covenants**\n\n>Heavenly Father,\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, I come before You as Your child, redeemed by the blood of Jesus. I stand on the finished work of the cross, and I declare that I belong to You—spirit, soul, and body.\n>\n>Lord, I renounce and break every generational altar raised by my ancestors, knowingly or unknowingly, that speaks against my destiny. Every blood sacrifice, every dedication, every evil covenant made on my behalf or by my bloodline—I reject and renounce it now in Jesus’ name.\n>\n>I declare that Jesus Christ is the only altar I am connected to. His blood speaks better things than the blood of Abel. Let the voice of the blood of Jesus silence every evil voice crying from family altars that seek to keep me in bondage.\n>\n>I break every spiritual chain, every curse, every covenant, every legal ground the enemy has used through these ancestral altars. I declare by the authority in the name of Jesus that I am delivered permanently from their power.\n>\n>Father, send Your fire to destroy every evil altar speaking against my life, my marriage, my children, my career, my health, and my destiny. Let every point of contact between me and those altars be consumed now by the fire of the Holy Ghost.\n>\n>I bind every familiar spirit operating through these altars. I cast them out in Jesus’ name. Let them never return.\n>\n>By the blood of Jesus, I rewrite my spiritual DNA. I disconnect myself and my future generations from every evil foundation and reconnect us to the covenant of life, blessing, and righteousness through Christ.\n>\n>I decree:\n>-   No more backwardness.\n>-   No more sickness or untimely death.\n>-   No more poverty or shame.\n>-   No more spiritual stagnation.\n>\n>I seal this deliverance with the blood of Jesus, and I declare that every broken altar shall never rise again. From today, I walk in freedom, victory, and divine favor, in Jesus’ mighty name.\n>\n>Amen.\n\n**You can pray this multiple times**, as led by the Holy Spirit, especially during fasting. Include Scripture like:\n\n-   Hebrews 12:24 – “...the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.”\n-   Galatians 3:13-14 – “Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law...”\n-   Jeremiah 1:10 – “...to root out, to pull down, to destroy, and to throw down, to build and to plant.”\n-   Colossians 2:14-15 – “...having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us...”\n",

First, they create a distraction because as long as you're paying attention, they can't take anything. They might notice where you keep your money. If it's in your left pocket, they might tap you on your right shoulder and then sneak their hand into your left pocket to steal your money without you noticing.\n\nThink about a hen. She's usually calm and harmless, but if you try to take one of her chicks or get too close, she'll defend them fiercely. So, if you wanted to steal one of her chicks without a fight, you'd need a distraction.\n\nWhen you're focused on a goal, sometimes you don't notice other important things slipping away. It's like a trick to keep you distracted from what truly matters.\n\nIn the past, a husband and wife would agree on who does what at home. The husband would go to work and earn money, while the wife took care of the house and kids. This way, the kids were always looked after, and any bad behavior was quickly noticed and corrected. The parents could guide their kids' upbringing.\n\nBut then, the wife might hear a little voice saying, \"You're being cheated! You can make as much money as your husband. You're wasting your life at home while he gets to have a career. What if something happens to him? How will you take care of the kids?\"\n\nSo, the wife gets a job and hands over her responsibilities to someone else. While she's busy working, guess who's left vulnerable? The kids, and the one who comes to take advantage of this is the devil.\n\nWhen couples start fighting, it's often because the devil is trying to distract them so he can influence their kids. He's not interested in the husband or wife; his target is the children.\n\nIf a husband suddenly finds other women showing interest in him, he shouldn't think it's because he's become more attractive. Let the husband know that when a snake holds his gaze at a frog, it is not because the frog is handsome or pretty, the snake is just being a snake and frogs are what they eat. It's just a distraction to ruin his family. I asked a young wife who was spying on her husband to gather evidence of cheating: while she was doing that, who was looking after her kids? When she got back, would her kids still be the same?\n\nThink about the hen and her chicks. As long as she's alert, no one can steal her chicks. But if she gets distracted, what then?\n\n### **2. Forbidden Knowledge:**\nThe devil used to be in heaven, so he knows a lot. And people are curious. Wouldn't it be cool to know how angels live in heaven, how they show up on Earth, or how to make them do stuff for you? What about talking to your dead mom? This curiosity makes some people join cults to learn secret things and try to get an edge over others.\n\nBut here's the catch: the leader of these cults is in chains, and the same thing happens to anyone who climbs the ranks. Knowledge without wisdom can mess you up.\n\nIn Revelation 2:24, it says:\n\n> *24 “But the rest of you in Thyatira have not followed this evil teaching; you have not learned what the others call ‘the deep secrets of Satan.’ I say to you that I will not put any other burden on you.*\n\nOccult books never use the real names of demons because of Christ. Instead, they use names from the Bible or call them saints. People who read these books often end up messed up. Let God's spirit help you decide what to read and what to avoid.\n\nRemember the Garden of Eden? The devil tricked Adam and Eve with knowledge: Genesis 3:11\n\n> _And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”_\n\nMovies often make witchcraft look cool, but it only leads to destruction.\nThe devil is really good at taking the truth and twisting it to lead you astray.\n\n### **3. Masks**\n\nWhen Jesus began to tell His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and die, Peter pulled Him aside and said, “Never, Lord! This shall never happen to You.” But Jesus turned and rebuked not Peter—but the one _behind the mask._\n\n **Matthew 16:21–23 (NIV):**  \n> 21 From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.  \n> 22 Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to you!”  \n> 23 Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”\n\nThe devil rarely shows his true face. He prefers masks—human faces through which he speaks, reasons, and persuades. When he wanted to discourage Jesus, he did not appear with horns and smoke. He wore Peter’s face. Peter’s concern seemed friendly, even loving, but it carried a poison designed to derail God’s plan. Jesus saw past the mask.\n\nSatan’s art of deception lies in his ability to **hide behind familiarity**. He can speak through a friend who tells you, “Live a little—try this,” or through a teacher who mocks your faith to make you feel small. He can wear the face of a parent, a mentor, or a leader. You hear the voice, you recognize the person—but if you listen closely, the words don’t sound like them anymore. The tone shifts, the motive twists, and suddenly you’re dealing with something ancient and unholy wearing human skin.\n\nThat is why 1 John 4:1–3 warns us:\n\n **1 John 4:1–3 (GNT):**  \n> My dear friends, do not believe all who claim to have the Spirit, but test them to find out if the spirit they have comes from God. For many false prophets have gone out everywhere.  \n> This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit: anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God.  \n> But anyone who denies this about Jesus does not have the Spirit from God. The spirit that he has is from the Enemy of Christ; you heard that it would come, and now it is here in the world already.\n\nEvil spirits wear people like masks—not always by possession, but through influence. They whisper thoughts into a mind until that person begins to speak those thoughts aloud. They wear a smile but speak destruction. They wear charm but carry manipulation. The mask looks human, but the intent is not.\n\nEven rulers and powerful leaders have worn these masks unknowingly. Paul wrote in **1 Corinthians 2:8**,\n\n> “None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.”\n\nThe devil’s masks are everywhere—in politics, entertainment, religion, and even friendship. The goal is the same: to trick believers into fighting flesh and blood instead of recognizing the spirit behind the mask.\n\nTo see through the mask, you must look beyond the face and listen for the source of the words.  \nDoes it draw you closer to Christ or away from Him?  \nDoes it feed your pride or humble your heart?  \nDoes it carry peace or provoke confusion?\n\nThe devil’s power lies in his disguise, but the Spirit of God gives discernment to those who seek it. Once you can see the mask, you can speak as Jesus did—**not to the person, but to the spirit behind it: “Get behind me, Satan.”**\n\n### **4. The Pressure of Urgency**\n\n> _“Be still, and know that I am God.” — Psalm 46:10_\n\nOne of the devil’s favorite tricks is **false urgency**—the pressure to act _now_ before you can think, pray, or discern. He knows that when you rush, you reason less, and when you reason less, you hear God less.\n\nThe enemy wraps his lies in time limits. He whispers, _“Decide now, or you’ll lose it.”_ He pushes you into choices that bypass peace. His goal is to make you react, not reflect—to move your feet before your spirit catches up.\n\nEvery deception feels urgent; every divine leading feels patient. God is never in a hurry. The devil always is. The Spirit invites; the enemy pressures.\n\nSo when you feel that anxious rush, that sudden _“you must act now”_ voice, pause. Breathe. Say, _“Let me think about it,”_ or _“Let me pray about it.”_ Heaven never punishes patience.\n\nDelays that make room for discernment often save destinies. Even Jesus waited for the Father’s timing. Learn to recognize that sacred stillness. It’s in the pause that truth reveals itself.\n\nYou need to learn to say, \"Let me think about it.\" Or, \"Let me pray about it.\" Get used to checking in with God before you make decisions. Give yourself some time to think things through before you act.\n\n### **5. Counterfeits:** \nThe enemy is a master of imitation, producing counterfeits of everything God has established. Just as there are true prophets, apostles, teachers, and the genuine work of the Holy Spirit, Satan raises up false versions of each. One of the most dangerous counterfeits is the false spirit often referred to as the Kundalini. This deceptive spirit mimics the movements of God’s power but leads people away from the truth of Christ.\n\nThose under the influence of the Kundalini spirit often display unsettling signs. These may include uncontrollable shaking, spasms, or strange body movements that resemble disorder rather than the peace of God. Some experience unbiblical mystical trances, so-called “energy awakenings,” or even out-of-body encounters that bear no grounding in Scripture. Others may manifest animal-like sounds, bursts of uncontrollable laughter, or a constant craving for spiritual highs and displays of “fire” or power without the fruit of humility, love, or obedience. Instead of drawing closer to Christ, such experiences often lead to resistance against Scripture, repentance, and true worship. The fruit that follows reveals its true nature—pride, confusion, restlessness, and sensuality rather than the character of the Holy Spirit.\n\nFreedom from the Kundalini spirit requires turning away from all false teachings, occult practices, and spiritual pride that give it access. Renouncing every false impartation, including connections to new age practices, yoga, or any other open doors, is essential. In the authority of Jesus’ name, the believer must command the Kundalini spirit to depart and never return. Deliverance is not complete without inviting the Spirit of truth to fill every part of life, as Ephesians 5:18 urges. Only the true Holy Spirit can cleanse, restore, and empower believers to walk in the purity of God’s power.\n\n### **6. Provocation:**\nThe devil uses provocation as one of his subtle but deadly traps against the believer. It is rarely just an impulsive moment; often it is a carefully staged scenario designed to stir up emotions and push the believer from walking in the Spirit to reacting in the flesh. By stirring up offense, insult, or injustice, the enemy engineers an environment where self-control becomes harder and the believer feels cornered emotionally. The aim of provocation is not just to make a believer angry but to shift their focus, cloud their judgment, and weaken their ability to pray or discern rightly. When provoked, many believers forget that their true struggle is not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers, and in that blindness they direct their anger toward people instead of the real enemy.\n\nWhen provocation succeeds, the chain reaction is predictable. Anger rises, self-control weakens, words are spoken hastily, actions are taken rashly, guilt and regret follow, and the believer becomes discouraged and ashamed. In this way, provocation turns a simple moment into a cycle of sin, condemnation, and spiritual dullness. The trap is further reinforced when the believer feels justified in their reaction—believing they had every right to respond harshly or fight back. This false sense of justification blinds them to repentance and keeps their heart hardened, allowing bitterness to grow. The ultimate goal is to block the flow of grace, disrupt prayer, and cut off the believer’s spiritual momentum.\n\nThis trap plays out in everyday life in many ways. At work, a colleague may deliberately take credit for your labor. The devil whispers that you must lash out and expose them, but in doing so you damage your testimony before others. In marriage or family, a sharp word from a spouse can tempt you to respond in kind, escalating a small disagreement into division and bitterness. In church, being overlooked or criticized can stir pride and push you toward withdrawal from fellowship, isolating you from the covering of the body. On the road, a careless driver can push you into reckless anger. On social media, a negative comment can stir the urge to clap back and defend your name before strangers. In each scenario, the person or event is not the real battle but only the bait; the devil waits for your reaction. The believer is not trapped until they choose to react in the flesh.\n\nThe Bible offers many examples of this trap. Moses, provoked by the constant complaints of the Israelites, struck the rock in anger instead of speaking to it as God commanded, and as a result lost the privilege of entering the Promised Land. Peter, provoked by fear and zeal when Jesus was arrested, cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant, only to be rebuked by the Lord. King Saul, provoked by the women’s song that praised David above him, gave in to jealousy and bitterness, which ultimately led to his downfall. Job’s wife, in his suffering, urged him to curse God and die, yet Job resisted the provocation and held his integrity. At the cross, Jesus Himself endured the sharpest provocation as He was mocked and challenged to prove Himself, but He chose silence and forgiveness, fulfilling God’s plan and breaking the enemy’s hold. These case studies show how provocation can bring down even great men of God when they react, but also how victory comes when the trap is resisted.\n\nThe key lesson is that provocation is like bait on a hook. The fish is not trapped until it bites, and the believer is not trapped until they react in the flesh. The safeguard is awareness, humility, and Spirit-led self-control. Recognize that the real enemy is unseen, pause and pray before reacting, guard your heart, and forgive quickly. To overcome provocation, believers must choose to respond in the Spirit rather than in the heat of the moment, for in that choice lies the difference between falling into the devil’s snare and walking in victory.\n\n### **7. Flattery:**\nThe devil often uses flattery as a subtle weapon to disarm and manipulate. Unlike open attack or provocation, flattery approaches softly, stroking the ego and feeding pride. By pretending to admire what you admire and like what you like, he creates the illusion of agreement and support. This shared interest lowers a believer’s guard, because human nature naturally trusts those who affirm us or seem to understand us. Flattery whispers, _“You are special… you deserve more… no one else appreciates you like I do.”_ It mimics encouragement but carries poison beneath the sugar.\n\nThe danger is that flattery blinds discernment. When the enemy pretends to share your tastes or passions, he positions himself as a companion, an ally, or even a friend. Once trust is gained, manipulation follows. The believer who yields to flattery begins to make decisions not based on truth or principle, but on the desire to keep the praise flowing. Pride grows quietly, and with it, compromise. What begins as harmless compliments soon becomes leverage, as the enemy nudges you toward choices you would have resisted if you had been on guard.\n\nThe Bible warns of this tactic. Proverbs 29:5 says, _“A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.”_ Flattery is not love; it is bait. The devil used it in Eden when he told Eve, _“You will be like God, knowing good and evil”_ (Genesis 3:5). He made her feel elevated, as though God was withholding something she deserved. Her desire for wisdom and likeness was twisted through flattery into disobedience. The same spirit was at work when Herod accepted the crowd’s flattery calling him a god (Acts 12:22–23). Instead of giving glory to God, Herod’s pride swelled, and judgment fell immediately.\n\nIn daily life, flattery may come through people who echo your likes, your ambitions, or your struggles — but not to strengthen you, rather to control or exploit you. A friend who always agrees with your weaknesses, a colleague who praises your shortcuts, a suitor who admires only your looks but not your faith — these can be tools in the enemy’s hand. The more you drink from the well of flattery, the more blind you become to truth, correction, and God’s guidance.\n\nThe safeguard against this trap is humility and discernment. A heart anchored in God’s approval is not swayed by excessive human praise. A believer who listens for God’s voice above man’s voice will recognize when affirmation crosses the line into manipulation. Gratitude for compliments is not sin, but dependence on them is dangerous. The devil knows that what he cannot provoke through anger, he may seduce through praise.\n",

                    "markdown": "# Wet Dreams\n\nThis is a topic not often discussed in the Church, but it affects many believers, especially young men and women pursuing purity. I want to share a perspective rooted in scripture and personal conviction: wet dreams are not spiritually neutral or normal for those walking with Christ.\n\nIn secular culture, they're often seen as a normal biological response. But from a biblical perspective, they can indicate deeper spiritual issues—specifically unclean spirits or what's known in deliverance circles as _spirit spouses_ (incubi/succubi).\n\nThese are demonic entities that attempt to forge counterfeit soul ties through sexual dreams or sensations during sleep. They often manifest as seductive dreams or arousal during sleep, leading to ejaculation or orgasm. Over time, these dreams can:\n\n- **Defile your spirit and body**, as 1 Corinthians 6:18 warns: “Flee from sexual immorality…”\n- **Open doors to torment and bondage**, especially in your thought life and relationships.\n- **Weaken your spiritual authority and clarity**, making it harder to hear God or walk in freedom.\n    \n**Signs You May Be Affected**:\n\n-   Recurrent sexual dreams with a consistent figure or presence.\n-   Feelings of shame, guilt, or spiritual heaviness after waking.\n-   Patterns of relationship sabotage or disinterest in marriage.\n-   Night terrors or sleep paralysis with sexual overtones.\n-   Sudden or unexplained financial dryness where income is hindered, opportunities dry up, or resources seem blocked despite effort. This is often overlooked but biblically consistent with demonic interference (see Haggai 1:6).\n\n**Breaking Free**:\n\n1.  **Repentance and Renunciation**  \n    Ask God for forgiveness for any past sexual sin (including masturbation, pornography, fornication, etc.) and renounce any spiritual agreements made knowingly or unknowingly.\n\t> _Heavenly Father, I come before You in humility and repentance. I confess every sin of sexual immorality—whether in thought, word, or deed. I renounce pornography, masturbation, fornication, lust, and every doorway I’ve opened to the enemy knowingly or unknowingly. I break every soul tie and covenant with spirit spouses, incubi, succubi, or any unclean spirit in Jesus’ name. I declare that I belong to Jesus Christ—spirit, soul, and body. Cleanse me with the blood of Jesus. I receive Your forgiveness, freedom, and healing. In Jesus’ name, amen._\n\n2.  **Spiritual Warfare & Deliverance Prayer**  \n    Bind and cast out any spirit of lust, incubus/succubus, or spiritual spouse in the name of Jesus. Declare your body and spirit belong to Christ alone (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).\n\t> _In the name of Jesus Christ, I take authority over every spirit of lust, incubus, succubus, spiritual spouse, or unclean demon that has accessed my life. I break every covenant, spiritual marriage, and soul tie with you by the power of the blood of Jesus. I command you to leave me now and never return. I bind you and cast you into the abyss, in the mighty name of Jesus. I declare my dreams are protected, my mind is renewed, and my body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. I plead the blood of Jesus over my bed, my dreams, and my subconscious. From this day forward, I walk in freedom. Amen._\n\n3.  **Fasting and Prayer**  \n    Some breakthroughs require deeper consecration (Mark 9:29). Set aside time to fast and seek God's deliverance.\n4.  **Close Doors**  \n    Remove materials, music, or media that feed lust or open demonic doors.\n5.  **Cover Yourself Before Sleep**  \n    Pray Psalm 91 aloud, plead the blood of Jesus over your dreams, and declare your sleep is protected.\n6. **Anoint Yourself with Oil:** Anointing yourself with consecrated oil (e.g., olive oil prayed over) is a biblical act of sanctification (James 5:14, Exodus 30:30). Place a drop on your forehead and declare:\n\t> _\"I consecrate myself—spirit, soul, and body—to the Lord Jesus Christ. Let this anointing be a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence and power over my life. No defilement, no demon, and no spirit spouse has any place in me. I am covered by the blood of Jesus and sealed by the Holy Spirit. In Jesus’ name, amen.\"_\n\nThis might sound intense or strange to some, but the spiritual realm is real, and our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit. If this resonates with you, I urge you not to ignore it. You’re not alone, and freedom is possible in Christ.\n\nYou may want to hear others' experiences, wisdom, or scriptures that have helped in this area.\n\n**Spirit Spouses Are Intelligent and Deceptive**\n\nOne thing many people don’t realize is that spirit spouses are not just sexual; they are highly intelligent, manipulative spirits. Their ultimate goal is not just to defile your body, but to keep you in spiritual bondage, away from true intimacy with God and healthy, God-ordained relationships.\n\nThese spirits often operate under deep deception, even masquerading as divine or religious voices. Remember, Satan himself can appear as “an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14). In some cases, they will:\n\n-   **Instruct you to do religious activities** (like fasting, praying a certain way, or isolating from others), not to grow closer to God, but to keep you busy, misdirected, and proud in your spiritual acts, all while they remain undetected.\n-   **Convince you it’s God speaking**, urging you toward actions that seem holy but actually lead to legalism, spiritual dryness, or confusion.\n-   **Distract you from discerning their presence**, using emotional manipulation, false visions, or seduction masked as “comfort” or “spiritual dreams.”\n    \nThis is why discernment and deliverance are vital. We must test every spirit (1 John 4:1) and ask the Holy Spirit to expose any unclean spirit pretending to be of God.\n\nDon’t fall for the trap of thinking that because you’re doing religious things, you’re immune. If something is feeding off your energy, robbing your peace, or hiding in secrecy, it needs to be confronted in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\n**Spirit Spouses Can Distort Gender Identity**\n\nAnother often-overlooked effect of spirit spouses is how they can distort a person’s perception of their own gender or sexuality. These spirits don’t just bring lust or defilement — they bring confusion. As with all demonic assignments, the goal is to attack God’s original design for identity, relationships, and the human body.\n\nSpirit spouses may:\n\n-   **Cause a man to feel emasculated**, emotionally unstable, or sexually passive — struggling with confidence, fatherhood, or healthy masculinity.\n-   **Cause a woman to feel overly dominant**, aggressive, or disconnected from her feminine identity — struggling with submission, nurture, or intimacy.\n-   Introduce **same-sex dreams, fantasies, or confusion** even if the person has never consciously invited such thoughts.\n-   Exploit childhood trauma or abuse to reinforce gender dysphoria or discomfort in one’s biological sex.\n    \n\nThese attacks are intentional and spiritual. They're meant to uproot your God-given identity and replace it with one shaped by spiritual bondage and lies.\n\nBut the good news is: Jesus came to restore us — spirit, soul, and body (1 Thessalonians 5:23). When these spirits are renounced and cast out, clarity, peace, and a healthy sense of gender identity can return by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\n**Spirit Spouses and Waking Up in Anger**\nOne of the more subtle but destructive effects of spirit spouses is the emotional disturbance they bring — especially waking up in sudden, unexplainable anger.\n\nMany believers experience mornings where they wake up irritated, agitated, or even furious, despite having no clear reason why. This is not just emotional or physical — it is often spiritual warfare in the realm of dreams.\n\nSpirit spouses can:\n\n- **Influence your emotions while you sleep**, planting unrest, conflict, or bitterness through dreams.\n- **Stir up feelings of rejection, jealousy, or rage**, especially if your soul is entangled with these spirits.\n- Use anger as a way to set the tone for your day, disrupting your peace, prayer life, and relationships from the moment you rise.\n- Mimic the feeling of spiritual oppression, making it difficult to even **want to pray or seek God** when you wake up.\n\nThis kind of attack is not from God. James 1:20 says, _“The anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.”_ If you find yourself consistently waking up angry or emotionally off-balance, it’s worth asking the Holy Spirit to reveal any spiritual cause — including the presence of spirit spouses.\n\nDeliverance brings peace. When the stronghold is broken, mornings can once again become a time of joy, clarity, and communion with God.\n\nStay pure and stay free.\n",

No defilement, no demon, and no spirit spouse has any place in me. I am covered by the blood of Jesus and sealed by the Holy Spirit. In Jesus’ name, amen.\"_\n\nThis might sound intense or strange to some, but the spiritual realm is real, and our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit. If this resonates with you, I urge you not to ignore it. You’re not alone, and freedom is possible in Christ.\n\nYou may want to hear others' experiences, wisdom, or scriptures that have helped in this area.\n\n**Spirit Spouses Are Intelligent and Deceptive**\n\nOne thing many people don’t realize is that spirit spouses are not just sexual; they are highly intelligent, manipulative spirits. Their ultimate goal is not just to defile your body, but to keep you in spiritual bondage, away from true intimacy with God and healthy, God-ordained relationships.\n\nThese spirits often operate under deep deception, even masquerading as divine or religious voices. Remember, Satan himself can appear as “an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14). In some cases, they will:\n\n-   **Instruct you to do religious activities** (like fasting, praying a certain way, or isolating from others), not to grow closer to God, but to keep you busy, misdirected, and proud in your spiritual acts, all while they remain undetected.\n-   **Convince you it’s God speaking**, urging you toward actions that seem holy but actually lead to legalism, spiritual dryness, or confusion.\n-   **Distract you from discerning their presence**, using emotional manipulation, false visions, or seduction masked as “comfort” or “spiritual dreams.”\n\nThis is why discernment and deliverance are vital. We must test every spirit (1 John 4:1) and ask the Holy Spirit to expose any unclean spirit pretending to be of God.\n\nDon’t fall for the trap of thinking that because you’re doing religious things, you’re immune. If something is feeding off your energy, robbing your peace, or hiding in secrecy, it needs to be confronted in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\n**Spirit Spouses Can Distort Gender Identity**\n\nAnother often-overlooked effect of spirit spouses is how they can distort a person’s perception of their own gender or sexuality. These spirits don’t just bring lust or defilement — they bring confusion. As with all demonic assignments, the goal is to attack God’s original design for identity, relationships, and the human body.\n\nSpirit spouses may:\n\n-   **Cause a man to feel emasculated**, emotionally unstable, or sexually passive — struggling with confidence, fatherhood, or healthy masculinity.\n-   **Cause a woman to feel overly dominant**, aggressive, or disconnected from her feminine identity — struggling with submission, nurture, or intimacy.\n-   Introduce **same-sex dreams, fantasies, or confusion** even if the person has never consciously invited such thoughts.\n-   Exploit childhood trauma or abuse to reinforce gender dysphoria or discomfort in one’s biological sex.\n\n\nThese attacks are intentional and spiritual. They're meant to uproot your God-given identity and replace it with one shaped by spiritual bondage and lies.\n\nBut the good news is: Jesus came to restore us — spirit, soul, and body (1 Thessalonians 5:23). When these spirits are renounced and cast out, clarity, peace, and a healthy sense of gender identity can return by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\n**Spirit Spouses and Waking Up in Anger**\nOne of the more subtle but destructive effects of spirit spouses is the emotional disturbance they bring — especially waking up in sudden, unexplainable anger.\n\nMany believers experience mornings where they wake up irritated, agitated, or even furious, despite having no clear reason why. This is not just emotional or physical — it is often spiritual warfare in the realm of dreams.\n\nSpirit spouses can:\n\n- **Influence your emotions while you sleep**, planting unrest, conflict, or bitterness through dreams.\n- **Stir up feelings of rejection, jealousy, or rage**, especially if your soul is entangled with these spirits.\n- Use anger as a way to set the tone for your day, disrupting your peace, prayer life, and relationships from the moment you rise.\n- Mimic the feeling of spiritual oppression, making it difficult to even **want to pray or seek God** when you wake up.\n\nThis kind of attack is not from God. James 1:20 says, _“The anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.”_ If you find yourself consistently waking up angry or emotionally off-balance, it’s worth asking the Holy Spirit to reveal any spiritual cause — including the presence of spirit spouses.\n\nDeliverance brings peace. When the stronghold is broken, mornings can once again become a time of joy, clarity, and communion with God.\n\nStay pure and stay free."

Where does your dust body go when God has finished copying the leaves from your mind and your heart?\n14. Where does your spiritual body go when God has finished copying the leaves from your mind and your heart?\n15. What happens to your spiritual body when God does not find anything in the heart and mind of your dust body, to copy into your spiritual body?\n16. Who caused it?\n17. Which body has life, the spiritual or dust bodies? John 6:63\n> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.\n18. What is the most beautiful thing in the whole world? \n19. Is the human soul more valuable than the whole world? Mark 8:36\n> And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?\n20. Is everybody around you that has a dust body alive?\n21. When do you say that a person is dead?\n22. When do you say that a person is sleeping?\n23. If a person is alive and yet they are dead, how do you raise such a person from the dead? \n24. How can the dead bury their dead? Matthew 8:18-22\n> 18 When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.  19 Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”\n>20 Jesus replied,  “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man  has no place to lay his head.”\n>21 Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”\n>22 But Jesus told him,  “Follow me,  and let the dead bury their own dead.”\n25. Why does Jesus say all who draw the sword shall die by the sword? Matthew 26:52\n> 48 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.”  49 Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!”  and kissed him.\n>50 Jesus replied,  “Do what you came for, friend.”\nThen the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.  51 With that, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword,  drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.\n>52 “Put your sword back in its place,”  Jesus said to him,  “for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.\n26. How are the words of Christ full of the Spirit and life? In John 6:63\n> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.\n27. How is God the God of the living, when Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are no longer with us? Mark 12:26-27\n> 26 Now about the dead rising—have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? 27 He is not the God of the dead,  but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”\n28. How does what comes out of a person defile the person? Matthew 15:11\n> 11 What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”\n29. What is the nature of the person with a spiritual body? John 3:8\n> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”\n30.

                    "markdown": "# Our Minds III\nMind Functions\n1. What are mind functions?\n2. What are some of the functions of your mind?\n3. Can your mind know *know* things?\n4. Can your mind *understand* things?\n5. Can your mind learn *wisdom*?\n6. What is a *fact*?\n7. When a raindrop falls in the ocean, and you are not aware of it, can you consider it as a fact or something that you know?\n8. What is knowledge?\n9. Which mind function enables you to be *aware* of facts?\n10. When you are not *aware* of a fact, can you consider it as knowledge?\n11. The ant knows its food and where to find them, knows the seasons, and also knows that the seasons change in a year. Give examples of knowledge that you also have.\n12. What is *earned* knowledge?\n13. Give examples of *earned* knowledge.\n14. What is *unearned* knowledge?\n15. Is unearned knowledge also called revelation?\n16. Give examples of *unearned* knowledge.\n17. When you hear a word, but you cannot make a connection between the word and any other thing that you are already aware of, do you understand the word?\n18. When you are aware of two facts but are *not* aware of how the facts are related, or how a change in one fact affects the other, do you understand?\n19. When do you say that you understand something?\n20. Which mind function enables you to understand things?\n21. The ant knows that food is plentiful in some seasons, whereas food is scarce in other seasons. Give examples of understanding that you also have.\n22. Can you understand something that you do not know?\n23. When trying to understand something and the knowledge that you have is not enough, do you stop obtaining knowledge or do you seek more knowledge?\n24. Can knowledge lead to understanding when it is not *ordered*?\n25. Give examples of how *ordered* knowledge leads to understanding\n26. Give examples of how *unordered* knowledge makes understanding difficult or almost impossible\n27. What is wisdom?\n28. Which mind function enables you to learn wisdom?\n29. The ant *knows* the seasons, that the seasons change, and *understands* that the seasons affect the availability of food. Wisdom tells the ant to gather a lot more food than it needs during summer and save more than it eats. Give examples of knowledge, leading to understanding, then finally leading to wisdom.\n30. What are some amazing things that you can do with wisdom?\n31. Does wisdom see all things at once, the end from the beginning?\n32. What is the reason for your answer?\n33. Give examples of how wisdom sees the end from the beginning, making God or even your parents try to stop you when you start forming certain habits.\n34. Does wisdom knowing the end from the beginning mean that the end *cannot* be changed, even if you changed your habits, or what you are doing now?\n35. Can you have understanding without knowledge?\n36. Can you have wisdom without knowledge and understanding?\n37. How are the three (3) mind functions connected?\n38. In Hosea 4:6 why are God's people destroyed?\n> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.\n39. Which mind function is crucial for the two (2) higher mind functions to do their work?\n40. Man learns about creatures that are too tiny for the eyes to see. Man also learns that these creatures, when they find themselves inside the human body, can cause harm such as sicknesses and diseases. Man, therefore, decides to wash his hands before eating and bathing twice a day.\n\t1. In which part of this process can knowledge be found?\n\t2. In which part of this process can you find understanding?\n\t3. Where is wisdom in this process?\n41. Man learns that he is not perfect. He also learns that others are not perfect and that offenses are bound to happen. Man learns that responding to an offense with violence will cause others to also respond with violence, which will in turn also lead to more violence, which will end in the destruction of everyone and everything that they had ever created. Man decides to forgive before he is even offended.\n\t1. In which part of this process can knowledge be found?\n\t2. In which part of this process can you find understanding?\n\t3. Where is wisdom in this process?\n42. How does knowledge lead to understanding, which leads to wisdom, which says that you must first seek before you find? Matthew 7:7\n> Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.\n43. How do the three (3) mind functions work together to make you a better version of yourself, and overcome your challenges?\n44. Does learning God's laws teach you wisdom? Leviticus 19:29\n> “’Do not degrade your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will turn to prostitution and be filled with wickedness.\n45. What is the reason for your answer?\n46. Read the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), Acts, Proverbs, and Psalms.\n",

And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, to devour her Child as soon as it was born.\n\t\n3. **Your number one responsibility towards the child is to protect them**\n\t- *Not food, shelter, money, etc*\n\t- *Do not just protect the body of the child, but their minds as well*\n\t- *Christ, the saviour of the world, had to be relocated until the right time for his own safety and the safety of his assignment.*\n4. **Listen to their stories after school to gather intelligence**\n\t- *Example of Erica's friend's attempt to introduce her to witchcraft*\n\t> My friend tells me that when you sleep at night, your spirit will be flying around.\n\t- *Example of a boy whose friend hits them on their spine when playing*\n\t> \tThere is this boy in my school. Anytime I play with him he will hit\n\t> me on my spine.\n\n5. **Sit by the beds on weekends and inquire about what is going on in their lives**\n\t- *This is like a blank cheque making the child bring up things they would not have shared with their parents*\n\t- *Their guard is also down*\n6. **Establish a policy of walking in pairs (in extreme cases where there is little to no supervision)**\n\t- > Ama and Sewa are sisters living in the same household. Sewa, the older one, is in her teenage years.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>One evening around 9 p.m., I suddenly had a craving for fruits and decided to head into town with a friend. As we approached the junction near their home, we saw Ama and Sewa walking back from the far end of the neighborhood.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>As I usually do when I see children out late, I asked my regular question: _“Where are you coming from, and where are you going?”_  \n\t\tSewa started to answer, but Ama quickly cut in, urging her not to lie. They admitted they had gone out with a male family friend and were just returning from the pharmacy.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>I asked, _“What did you go to the pharmacy for?”_\n\t\t>\n\t\t>Sewa hesitated. Then, with a little prompting from Ama to be honest, she finally revealed the disturbing truth. The man had planned to sleep with Sewa that night. But when he found out that the girls always went out together and never alone—partly because they feared what I might do if I ever caught them in trouble—his plan was disrupted.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>He spent the entire outing trying to separate Sewa from Ama, but failed. They went to the pharmacy to buy condoms, but fortunately, the shop had run out. Frustrated, the man gave up and let them walk home.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>I personally walked the girls back to their house that night. The next morning, I returned to speak with their grandmother. I was firm and clear: that man was never to be allowed near their home or around the children again.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>That night, their decision to never walk alone had protected them from a serious danger.\n7. **Sometimes children are stolen from their parents even though they live with them**\n\t- *The child eats your food, drinks your water, sleeps under your roof and yet no longer belongs to you because they obey another voice*\n\t- *It is during a fight between parents that a grown man driving his expensive car will stop your daughter and buy them airtime worth GHS 300.00*\n\t- These are dead men riding in their metal coffins\n\t- The child loses respect for men and begins to disregard parent's instructions\n\t- *When parents fight each other, the children are usually the target*\n\t- *Sometimes, a passenger refuses to stop arguing with a driver's mate, and the driver keeps looking back in an attempt to settle the dispute while his vehicle is moving forward. The goal is to cause an accident.*\n\t- *When a chicken will stand against you because you approach her chicks, and you wish to steal her chicks without any resistance, which approach will you take?*\n\t- > Last year, her husband—who had never shown any issues with alcohol—suddenly began drinking heavily. She believes that through her persistent efforts, alongside her mother-in-law’s support, they were able to pull him back from the brink of full-blown alcoholism.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>But this year, things took another troubling turn. He abruptly gave up drinking, only to begin chasing after other women.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>Now, she’s deeply worried—afraid of losing him entirely and even more concerned about the impact on their three children. Divorce has crossed her mind, and she’s begun wondering if she needs proof of his unfaithfulness to take that step.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>But as she spends her time following his movements—either to catch him in the act or to somehow help him find his way again—one haunting question remains:\n\t\t>\n\t\t>Who is watching over her children while she’s watching him?\n\t\tCan she be certain that the children she left at home will be the same ones she returns to?\n\n8. **Pray for your children**\n\t- *Sometimes God reveals some things to us that would be impossible to detect about our children*\n\t- > A pastor was raising his daughter in a spiritually sound environment. She rarely left the house except to run errands, and she always returned promptly. There was never any reason to suspect that something was wrong. In their home, gospel music played constantly, and a prayerful atmosphere was carefully maintained to guard against spiritual darkness.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>The daughter mostly kept to herself in her room, only occasionally stepping out to grab a snack—usually ice cream—before retreating again. Nothing in her routine seemed unusual.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>But one day, as the pastor passed by her room, he felt an unusual prompting in his spirit to take a closer look. Out of concern, he glanced through a small upper window that provided a view into her room. What he saw left him deeply disturbed. Her behavior, though subtle and previously unnoticed, had concealed a troubling secret.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>This raised two important questions:  \n\t\tWhat voice prompted the pastor to look that day?\n\t\tAnd where had his daughter been exposed to such ideas that led her down this path?\n\t\t\n9. **The mind is a soil**\n\t- *The words you hear with your ears, the things you see with your eyes, are seeds*\n\t- *The seeds grow when you think about them*\n\t- *When your mind is good, your body will be good*\n\t- *When your mind is bad, your body will also be bad*\n\t- *Can you watch everything, and hear everything if you wish to grow?*\n\t- *Should the mind be protected?*\n\t- > A woman who sold fruits would often pass by the home of a young girl and her mother, who also sold fruits and vegetables. One day, as usual, the fruit seller stopped to greet the girl’s mother—they were friends—and began chatting.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>During the conversation, the woman turned her attention to the child and began making inappropriate remarks about her appearance. “You’re so developed, sometimes I can’t tell if you’re a child or an adult,” she said, half-jokingly.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>The girl’s mother stood there, unsure of how to respond. She felt helpless and uncomfortable as the woman continued making comments about her daughter’s body. Though she wanted to stop it, the words never came. Eventually, the fruit seller moved on, and the moment passed—or so it seemed.\n\t\t>\n\t\t>Months later, the effects of that encounter began to surface. The young girl, once carefree, had become overly conscious of her body. She began exercising obsessively, often caught trying to \"fix\" her figure—despite being perfectly healthy and already in great shape. What seemed like a passing comment had planted a seed of insecurity.\n\t\t\n10. **Control what the child hears and sees**\n\t- *Control the kind of people you bring them around, especially at funerals*\n\t- *Shield them from certain conversations eg. public transport, adult visitors, etc.*\n\t- *TV should be programmed*\n\t- *Example of children now into chanting and invoking spirits*\n\t> Bertha sings a song from her village and becomes fully possessed, she has to be retrained by strong men because the spirit wants to throw her into a flame and hit her body against the walls.\n\t\n11. **Avoid the temptation of buying smartphones for the child's homework**\n\t- *Their teachers should score them anything they want and it's fine*\n12. **The issue with sex movies**\n\t- *Damages the child's mind, polluting their thoughts*\n\t- *It makes them filthy making them distance themselves from God and their parents*\n\t-  *A demon binds them, permanently trapping them sometimes well into their old age*\n\t- *Sex movies and romance are not what makes a marriage last and should be removed from every device that a parent owns so the child is not exposed to it*\n\t- Examples of lust issues\n\n\t> *Lust will be the death of me*\n\t> \n\t> It's over for me. Lust alone will kill me. It's the same thing every\n\t> day. Resist lust for a day or two. And give up. Repeat, repeat,\n\t> repeat. Then the conviction comes and it's right back to square one.\n\t> I've gotten to a point where the lord no longer lingers in my mind\n\t> while I do these things. It's no longer conviction. This time it was\n\t> different. At least this time I felt shame. I wanted to post this, for\n\t> whatever reason. I'm not sure. I fear I’ve committed blasphemy against\n\t> the holy spirit.

Is it physical growth alone that makes you a man, or must there be some intentional training and initiation?\n\t- *Example of the woman who says that boys do not sweep*\n8. **Define the child to the child**\n\t- *Who has defined their child to them and what did you tell them?*\n\t- God calls you to be different\n\t- You are a lady\n\t- You are a gentleman\n\t- The child may not believe you initially, but they will over time\n\t- Sometimes you tell the children of other parents, that they are something that they are not, in the hope that they believe what you say about them, especially when their parents accuse them of something they have done, and you know they actually did it\n\t- \"You are a good child!\"\n\t- \"I have met many bad children, and you are not a bad child.\"\n\t- \"I do not believe that you are capable of doing such a thing.\"\n9. **Seize every opportunity that you are together to tell the child why things must be done a certain way**\n\t- Gardening\n\t- Washing\n\t- Walks\n\t- Etc.  \n\t- Organize activities that foster such moments\n11. **Let them know what you expect from them**\n\t- *What you expect from them is not a house or a car, but to see what God has  put in them come out, flourish, and be used to help others*\n\t- *You will be disappointed to see them abort what God has put in them*\n\t- *God will also be disappointed*\n12. **The child has a conscience**\n\t\t- *This serves as a guard and prompts the child when they are about to do that which is NOT done*\n\t\t- *But the conscience has to be taught and trained to function effectively when prompting the child*\n\t\t- *Teaching them God's laws grows their consience*\n\t\t- *Example of Kessiwa realizing that her family had conscience participated in idol worship after they had sacrificed fowl*\n\t\t- *Repeat this at least once a month*\n\t\t- Joshua 1:8\n\n\t> Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and\n\t> night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then\n\t> you will be prosperous and successful.\n\n13. **Socialize the child**\n\t- *Let the child be around you while you perform certain actions*\n\t- *Talk while taking walks, cooking, gardening, caring for the pets*\n14. **Don't get tired of speaking to the child**\n\t- *Children will make you feel like you are wasting your time talking*\n\t- *When you are not around, it is your voice that will remind them to do the right thing*\n15. **A well-developed mind is an inheritance**\n\t- *Your treasures are in your heart and your mind*\n\t- Knowledge of God\n\t- Good advice\n\t- Life skills\n\t- Wisdom \n\t- Teachings\n\t- Example of my mum being encouraged by seeing a woman who used farming to take her son through school to become a doctor\n16. **Teach the child your process**\n\t- Let the child know how they became the way they are because of your process\n\t- Some adults think that they were born good\n\t- When the adults do not know the process they end up having bad children even though they are good\n",

What makes you open your mouth to speak a word?\n4. What are *motives, intents, meanings, motivating thoughts*?\n5. Does God know your *motives, intents, meanings, motivating thoughts*?\n6. Who hears you first when you utter a word, God or you?\n7. Does God need you to speak a word before he knows your *motives, intents, meanings, motivating thoughts*?\n8. If you knew what a person *meant* before they spoke, would you wait to hear what they had to say before finding out their *meaning*?\n9. Do words have value in prayer?\n10. If you know that your friend *intends* to give you a gift, do you go ahead and take the gift?\n11. If words are valueless in prayer, why does God require you to speak when you pray, anyway?\n12. If words are valueless in prayer, should you use many words when you pray to try to impress God? Matthew 6:7\n> And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.\n13. Does God answer your prayers based on your *motives, intents,  meanings, motivating thoughts*, or the words that you speak when you pray? James 4:3\n> And when you ask, you do not receive it, because your motives are bad; you ask for things to use for your own pleasures.\n14. Should you be sincere when you pray (say what you *mean*), or say one thing when you *mean* another? Psalm 145:18\n> The  Lord  is near  to all who call on him,  \nto all who call on him in truth.\n15. In what ways do humans say one thing when they *mean* another?\n16. In what ways can you be sincere in your prayers?\n17. When you plant crops close to a river and you want the river to flow to the crops, what will you have to do?\n18. Can you move the crops to the river, the river to the crops, or dig trenches from the river to the crops so that the river would flow to the crops?\n19. If God was an endless, boundless river, and your body was the land, and your mind, heart, conscience, etc. were the crops, how will you be able to let God, which is the river, flow to the crops, your will, heart, mind, conscience, desires, tongue?\n20. If God were an endless river flowing from within you, and you wanted him to fill all the members of your body(heart, mind, will, conscience, etc.), what would you have to do?\n21. How do you fill your mind with God?\n22. How do you fill your heart with God?\n23. How do you fill your conscience with God?\n24. How did Christ give his will to the Father? Luke 22:42\n> Not my will, but yours be done \n25. What kind of things will you wish for when your heart has been filled with God? \n26. How will you think when your mind has been filled with God?\n27. How will you behave the more trenches you dig in yourself for God to fill?\n28. Are you more likely to do the will of God when you are filled with God?\n29. Will you fall into temptations when the members of your body are filled with God? Matthew 26:41\n> “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\n30. Are you likely to make the right choices when the members of your body have been given to God and filled with God?\n31. When you have a difficult decision to make, do you ask God to fill you so that you can make the right choice, or do you worry?\n32. When you are faced with challenges, should you ask God to take away the challenge, or fill yourself with God through prayer, so that you will be able to go through it?\n33. When things are not going your way, should you complain to God, or fill yourself with God through prayer, so that you will know the right thing to do?\n34. Is prayer for filling ourselves with God to do the will of God, or is prayer for instructing God, and telling God what to do?\n35. Will you always receive a word from God when you pray?\n36. When you choose God's will when you pray, is God able to naturally make you do his will and purpose for your life?\n37. Pray and choose God's will for your life each day.\n> Heavenly Father, I choose your will over mine, in the name of Jesus.\n38. Did God create Man before creating his food, or his food before creating Man?\n39. Did God wait for the Man to pray for food before providing him with his food?\n40.

Prayer of Willingness to Listen and Receive\n> _Inspired by: “Listen, listen to Me, and eat what is good, and you will delight in the richest of fare.” (Isaiah 55:2)_\n>\n>Father, teach me to listen.  \nSo often I chase things that do not nourish my soul.  \nOpen my ears to Your voice, and draw me to Your truth.  \nFeed me with Your Word, that I may delight in what is good.  \nHelp me live by every word that comes from You.  \nAmen.\n3.

Prayer of Seeking and Returning\n> _Inspired by: “Seek the Lord while He may be found; call on Him while He is near.” (Isaiah 55:6)_\n>\n>Lord, I seek You now while You are near.  \nForgive me for the times I drifted away from You.  \nI return with a heart that longs to be close again.  \nDraw near to me as I draw near to You.  \nLet me not miss the moment of Your mercy.  \nAmen.\n5. Prayer of Repentance and Surrender\n> _Inspired by: “Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts...” (Isaiah 55:7)_\n>\n>Merciful God,  \nI lay down every thought and way that is not pleasing to You.  \nCleanse my heart, renew my mind, and lead me in the path of righteousness.  \nHave compassion on me, and pour out Your pardon.  \nYour mercy is abundant, and I trust in Your forgiveness.  \nAmen.\n6. Prayer to Embrace God’s Higher Ways\n> _Inspired by: “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways...” (Isaiah 55:8–9)_\n>\n>Sovereign Lord,  \nYour wisdom far exceeds mine.  \nHelp me trust Your higher ways, even when I do not understand.  \nGive me faith to walk the path You choose for me.  \nLet my heart rest in the knowledge that You see what I cannot.  \nAmen.\n7. Prayer for the Power of God's Word to Work in Me\n> _Inspired by: “So is My word that goes out from My mouth: it will not return to Me empty...” (Isaiah 55:11)_\n>\n>God of the Living Word,  \nLet Your Word take root in my heart and accomplish its purpose.  \nMay it convict, heal, build, and transform me.  \nSend it forth like rain, and let it bear fruit in my life.  \nI yield to its power, trusting that it never returns void.  \nAmen.\n8. Prayer of Joyful Expectation\n> _Inspired by: “You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace...” (Isaiah 55:12)_\n>\n>Lord of Peace,  \nLead me out of darkness and into the joy of Your presence.  \nLet Your peace go before me and Your joy rise within me.  \nCause my life to echo the beauty of Your restoration.  \nMake me a witness to the joy that only You can give.  \nAmen.\n",

John 5:5-9\n> 5 A man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years. 6 Jesus saw him lying there and knew the man had been sick a long time. Jesus said to him,  “Would you like to be healed?” 7 The sick man said, “Sir, I have no one to put me in the pool when the water is moving. While I am coming, another one gets in first.” 8 Jesus said to him,  “Get up! Pick up your bed and walk.” 9 At once the man was healed and picked up his bed and walked. This happened on the Day of Rest.\n2. Did Jesus speak life or death?\n3. What did it take to heal the man at the pool?\n4. How did Jesus make the disciples receive the Holy Spirit? John 20:22\n> When Jesus had said this, He breathed on them. He said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.\n5. Did Christ speak life or death?\n6. What did it take to impart the Holy Spirit to his disciples?\n7. How did Christ calm the storm? Mark 4:35-41\n> 35 That day when evening came, he said to his disciples,  “Let us go over to the other side.”  36 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat.  There were also other boats with him.  37 A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.  38 Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?”\n>\n>39 He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves,  “Quiet! Be still!”  Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.\n>\n>40 He said to his disciples,  “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?”\n>\n>41 They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”\n8. Did Christ speak life or death?\n9. What did it take to calm the storm?\n10. When you are going through problems of life, should you become reckless with your words, or speak only what you wish to see come to life?\n11. Has God ever said in his word, \"Today, I am dead?\"\n12. Did Christ speak life or death? Matthew 16:18\n> And so I tell you, Peter: you are a rock, and on this rock foundation I will build my church, and not even death will ever be able to overcome it.\n13. How did Jesus forgive his sins? Matthew 9:1-2\n> Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.  2 Some men brought to him a paralyzed man,  lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith,  he said to the man,  “Take heart,  son; your sins are forgiven.”\n14. Should we take our words for granted?\n15. In what ways do we take our words for granted each day?\n",

Is God able to divide himself without losing himself?\n7. Who is the original flame?\n8. What does the Father do, personally?\n9. If the Father gives personality to all individuals, is he a personality himself, or a super personality?  \n10. Should you say that you have a certain personality because of the day that you were born? \n11. Who is the second flame to come out of the original flame?\n12. Why is the Son also called the Word? John 1:1\n>In the beginning, was the Word,  and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.\n13. Is the Word a person or a book?\n14. Has anybody seen the Father before?\n15. If you wish to know what the Father has to say, whom do you go to?\n16. How did humans know the words of the Father in Matthew 5:48?\n>Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n17. What else does the Son do apart from being the Word? John 1:1-3\n> In the beginning was the Word,  and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.  2 He was with God in the beginning.  3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. \n18. Who created our universe and everything in it including humans?\n19. In Genesis 1:3, who said let there be light, and who created the light?\n> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.\n20. Who is the third flame to come out of the original flame?\n21. What does the Spirit do, personally? John 6:63\n> It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.\n22. What makes the three Gods, Father, Son, and Spirit a Trinity?\n23. How do the three Gods, Father, Son, and Spirit agree as one?\n24. Who is God, and who is \"us?\" Genesis 1:26\n> Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky,  over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”\n25. Will you exist if all but one member of the Trinity does not agree?\n26. What does it mean to be *just*?\n27. Can the Father be *just* without the agreement of the Trinity?\n28. Is every new flame that comes out of the Father also God?\n29. Which other flames came out of the Father, who is also God but not the Father?\n30. Who are the seven Spirits of God? Isaiah 11:2\n> 1. The Spirit of Wisdom  \n> 2. The Spirit of the Lord  \n> 3. The Spirit of Understanding\n> 4. The Spirit of Counsel  \n> 5. The Spirit of Power  \n> 6. The Spirit of Knowledge\n> 7. The Spirit of the Fear of the Lord\n31. Where does the spirit of God in man come from?\n32. Does God dwell in Time, Eternity, or both?\n33. Is Eternity a long time?\n34. What is the reason for your answer?\n35. Is Eternity and Time the same thing or completely different?\n36. How do things happen in Time?\n37. How do things happen in Eternity?\n38. What is the Eternal life? John 17:3\n> 3 Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\n39. Is Eternal life God's way of life?\n40. Are you living the Eternal life when you do not know God?\n41. Are you living the Eternal life when you do not think, speak, and act like God?\n42. When do you say that a person has Eternal life?\n43. Is Eternal life a gift?\n44. How do you receive the gift of Eternal life? John 10:27-28\n> 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:\n>\n>28 And I give unto them Eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.\n45. Do you dwell in Time or Eternity?\n46. Is everything created?\n47. Is God created or uncreated?\n48. Who created existence?\n49. Does God *exist*, or God *Is*, and it is through him that other beings are brought into existence? Exodus 3:14\n> God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “You shall say this to the Israelites, 'I AM has sent me to you. ' ”\n",

In John 3:16, who is God, and who is his one and only son?\n>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\n2. Who created all things? John 1:1-3\n> In the beginning was the Word,  and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.  2 He was with God in the beginning.  3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.\n3. Did Christ exist after he was born in this world, or has he always been, and it is through him that all humans exist? John 8:48-58\n> 48 The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan  and demon-possessed?”\n> \n> 49 “I am not possessed by a demon,”  said Jesus,  “but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.  50 I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.  51 Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.”\n> \n> 52 At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death.  53 Are you greater than our father Abraham?  He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”\n> \n> 54 Jesus replied,  “If I glorify myself,  my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.  55 Though you do not know him,  I know him.  If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.  56 Your father Abraham  rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”\n> \n> 57 “You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”\n> \n> 58 “Very truly I tell you,”  Jesus answered,  “before Abraham was born,  I am!”\n4. Is Christ God?\n5. Did Christ come into the world as a man, doing God's will, or as God? John 14:10\n> 10 Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.\n6. Did Christ go through life's various stages and challenges as a man or as God?\n7. From his childhood, did Christ know that he was God? Mark 10:17-18\n> 17 As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”\n> \n> 18 “Why do you call me good?”  Jesus answered.  “No one is good—except God alone.\n8. Did Christ learn about the Father, and start his fellowship with the Father the same way as every other human would have, by going to Sunday school, studying the scriptures, and doing the will of the Father, until he and the Father had become one? Luke 2:46, Luke 2:52\n>Luke 2:46\n>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the  teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.\n>\n>Luke 2:52\n> “And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.”\n9. Who confirmed Jesus Christ as a true child of God, when his will and the Father's will had become one, after doing God's will for a long time? Matthew 3:13-17\n> 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. 14 But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”\n> \n> 15 Jesus replied,  “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.”  Then John consented.\n> \n> 16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened,  and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.  17 And a voice from heaven  said,\n> “This is my Son,  whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”\n10. Will you also receive a confirmation from the Father in your spirit when your will and the Father's will have become one after doing his will for some time? \n11. Who is the thief, what does he want, and what does Christ want for every human? John 10:10\n>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\n12. Who gave you life?\n13. If Satan can make you turn against your Father in Heaven has he stolen you from him?\n14. In what ways does Satan try to destroy the children of God?\n15. Will Satan try to kill you if all his attempts fail?\n16. In what way did Christ expect people to know who he was? John 10:24-25\n> 24 The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”\n> \n> 25 Jesus answered,  “I did tell you,  but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me,\n17. Are you *something* because of what you do every day, or what you say that you are?\n18. How is Christ the way to the Father? John 14:4-6\n> 4 You know the way to the place where I am going.” 5 Thomas  said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”\n> \n> 6 Jesus answered,  “I am the way and the truth and the life.  No one comes to  the Father except through me.\n19. What examples did Christ *do* and *teach* humans as the way to become like Christ? (Read the Gospels)\n20. Can you believe in Christ without practicing his teachings?\n21. Which examples of Christ are you following now?\n22. Was Christ willing to forgive the people who had tortured him and hanged him on the cross to die? Luke 23:34\n> 34 Jesus said, “Father,  forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.\n23. Which character and mind will be formed in you when you believe in Christ by acting on his word?\n24. How can Christ be formed in you?\n25. When you blow air into a balloon and place it on a bucket of water, will it float or will it sink? \n26. When you press the balloon to the bottom of the bucket, and you leave it what will happen to the balloon?\n27. How is Christ the resurrection and the life? John 11:20-26\n> 20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.\n> \n> 21 “Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died.  22 But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.”\n> \n> 23 Jesus said to her,  “Your brother will rise again.”\n> \n> 24 Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection  at the last day.”\n> \n> 25 Jesus said to her,  “I am the resurrection and the life.  The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;  26 and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.  Do you believe this?”\n28. When you do not have the character and mind of Christ can you be resurrected?\n29. In what way is a person who has become like Christ, like a balloon?\n30. Through Christ, should there be other Christs?\n31. Does Christ's resurrection teach humans that when a man has formed Christ in them, they are *capable* of being resurrected, and that resurrection is *possible*?\n32. Did Christ wish to go through the suffering on the cross, or he went through it because it was the Father's will? \n> “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”\n33. Are you also willing to do the Father's will even when it does not make you happy?\n34. Did the people of his day find it easy to accept the teachings of Christ, including the disciples?\n35. Did the disciples believe that Christ would resurrect after his death on the cross? John 20:24-29\n> 24 Now Thomas  (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.  25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”\n> \n> But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side,  I will not believe.”\n> \n> 26 A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said,  “Peace  be with you!”  27 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”\n> \n> 28 Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”\n> \n> 29 Then Jesus told him,  “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”\n36. Did Christ know that for the people to truly believe him he had to give them a sign? Matthew 12:38-39\n> 38 Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign  from you.”\n> \n> 39 He answered,  “A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.\n37. What sign would he give them to make them believe?\n38. If Christ had not died in public, would his resurrection have meant anything to the people of his day? \n39. If Christ had not resurrected from the dead, would his message have taken deeper roots in the hearts of the people, making them believe that all that he said was true? John 11:25\n> Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;\n40. When the people believed him after his resurrection were they willing to spread the message to other towns and even die while doing so?\n41. In what way did the Father use Christ's public humiliation and death on the cross to make Christ's message take deeper roots in the hearts of men after his resurrection, to the point where they were willing to die for it?\n42. Did the Father use what the Devil had planned for evil, for good, by letting Christ go through public humiliation and death, or did the Father plan to have Christ crucified all along?\n43. Can humans enter God's kingdom and be saved from darkness if only they will believe in Christ's teachings?\n44. If the price to pay for Christ's message to be accepted by the people was death by the cross, and later resurrection, was Christ willing to do what it would take by paying the price?\n45. Did the Father pay the price by giving his very best, his only begotten son?\n46. Does the Father allowing Christ to go through so much suffering teach humans how far he is willing to go to rescue even the most stubborn human from darkness?\n47. Does Christ humbling himself even unto death, teach humans how far we must be willing to go to do God's will?\n48. Can the problem of humans living in darkness, and dying because of it, be solved?\n49. Is there a price to pay to solve it?\n50. Are you willing to pay the price?\n51. Did Christ come to replace the laws of the prophets, or improve upon them and give them their full meaning? Matthew 5:33-37, Matthew 5:38-39, Matthew 19:8-11, Matthew 5:43-46, Matthew 5:27-28, Matthew 5:17\n>Matthew 5:33-37\n>33 “Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.’ 34 But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne; 35 or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 36 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. 37 All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.\n>\n>Matthew 5:38-39 \n>38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ 39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.\n>\n>Matthew 19:8-11\n>8 Jesus replied,  “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.  9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”\n>\n>Matthew 5:43-46\n>43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?\n>\n>Matthew 5:27-28\n>27 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\n>\n>Matthew 5:17\n>Don't suppose I came to do away with the Law and the Prophets. I did not come to do away with them, but to give them their full meaning.\n52. Does following Christ's teachings mean that you no longer have to obey the law? Matthew 5:19\n> Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\n53. Can you become perfect by following laws alone?\n54. What is the reason for your answer?\n55. Do the laws of God cover every aspect of human living and behavior?\n56. Can you become perfect by following the laws of God and Christ who by taking on human nature also understands you and knows how to deal with the things that stop you from becoming perfect? Matthew 5:20\n> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.\n57. Did Christ come to start a new religion named after him, or to establish the kingdom of God on earth?\n58. Where is the kingdom of God on earth? Luke 17:20-21\n> 20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:\n> \n> 21 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\n59. How do you enter God's kingdom?\n60. Can you enter God's kingdom without submitting yourself to God, daily? Luke 22:42\n>“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”\n61. Did the Jews accept or reject Christ's teachings? John 10:20-21\n> 20 Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?”\n> \n> 21 But others said, “These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon.  Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”\n62. What would happen to Jerusalem shortly after Christ had been taken up into Heaven? Luke 19:41-44\n>41 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it  42 and said,  “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes.  43 The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.  44 They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls.  They will not leave one stone on another,  because you did not recognize the time of God’s coming  to you.”\n63. When Christ was about to be crucified, and the women wept for him, why did he say to them \"Weep for yourselves\"? Luke 23:27-28\n>27 A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.  28 Jesus turned and said to them,  “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.\n64. What happened to Jerusalem shortly after Christ had been taken up into Heaven?\n65. If the Jews had accepted Christ's message would the Romans have destroyed their cities and temples and killed so many of them?\n66. If all men accept God as their Father, will they treat each other as brothers and sisters, or as foreigners and enemies? John 4:7-9\n> 7 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her,  “Will you give me a drink?”  8 (His disciples had gone into the town  to buy food.)\n> \n> 9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)\n67. If all men accept each other as brothers and sisters, will they continue to fight each other or allow the peace of God to reign on earth?\n68. What is a parable?\n69. What is the parable of the tenants? Luke 20:9-19\n> 9 He went on to tell the people this parable:  “A man planted a vineyard,  rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time. \n> 10 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.  11 He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.  12 He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.\n> \n> 13 “Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love;  perhaps they will respect him.’\n> \n> 14 “But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’  15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\n> \n> “What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?  16 He will come and kill those tenants  and give the vineyard to others.”\n> \n> When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!”\n> \n> 17 Jesus looked directly at them and asked,  “Then what is the meaning of that which is written:\n> \n> “‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?\n> \n> 18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”\n> \n> 19 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.\n70. What does the vineyard represent in the parable?\n71. Who is the owner of the vineyard? \n72. Who are the tenants? Matthew 23:29-35\n> 29 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.  30 And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’  31 So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.  32 Go ahead, then, and complete  what your ancestors started!\n> \n> 33 “You snakes! You brood of vipers!  How will you escape being condemned to hell?  34 Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify;  others you will flog in your synagogues  and pursue from town to town.  35 And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel  to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah,  whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.\n73. In what ways did the tenants beat and treat the servants shamefully?\n74. What is the fruit of the vineyard?\n75. Who were the servants sent to the vineyard to collect the fruits of the vineyard?\n76. Who was the son sent to collect the vineyard's fruits?\n77. Did Christ come into the world to be humiliated and killed or to draw men into the Father's kingdom by his teachings and lifestyle?\n78. Was Christ sacrificed or betrayed and murdered? Acts 7:52-53\n>52 Was there any prophet that your ancestors did not persecute? They killed God's messengers, who long ago announced the coming of his righteous Servant. And now you have betrayed and murdered him. 53 You are the ones who received God's law, that was handed down by angels—yet you have not obeyed it!”\n79. What is the harvest, and who are the laborers? Matthew 9:35-38\n>35 And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction.  36 When he saw the crowds,  he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless,  like sheep without a shepherd.  37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;  38 therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to  send out laborers into his harvest.”\n80. Was Christ able to forgive sins before he was crucified? Matthew 9:2-7\n> 2 Some men brought to him a paralyzed man,  lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith,  he said to the man,  “Take heart,  son; your sins are forgiven.”\n> \n> 3 At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!”\n> \n> 4 Knowing their thoughts,  Jesus said,  “Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?  5 Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?  6 But I want you to know that the Son of Man  has authority on earth to forgive sins.”  So he said to the paralyzed man,  “Get up, take your mat and go home.”  7 Then the man got up and went home.\n81. Did humans have to spill the blood of Christ to be forgiven of their sins?\n82. In what way did Christ fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah in Isaiah 53:4? Matthew 8:14-17\n> 14 When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.  15 He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.\n> \n> 16 When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. 17 This was to fulfill  what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:\n> \n> “He took up our infirmities   and bore our diseases.”\n\n83. What is the story of the woman caught in adultery? John 8:1-11\n> 8 1 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.\n> \n> 2 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. 3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group 4 and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” 6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.\n> \n> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the\n> ground.\n> \n> 9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”\n> \n> 11 “No one, sir,” she said.\n> \n> “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”\n84. Was it possible for humans to stop sinning before Christ was crucified? John 8:11\n85. How do you stop sinning?\n86. Was Christ able to teach all that he wanted to before he was taken up into Heaven? John 16:12\n>“I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.\n87. How did Christ know that the people could not bear all that he had to say to them? John 3:1-12\n> 3 Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus  who was a member of the Jewish ruling council.  2 He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi,  we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs  you are doing if God were not with him.”\n> \n> 3 Jesus replied,  “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.”\n> \n> 4 “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be\n> born!”\n> \n> 5 Jesus answered,  “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.  6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.  7 You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’  8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”\n> \n> 9 “How can this be?”  Nicodemus asked.\n> \n> 10 “You are Israel’s teacher,”  said Jesus,  “and do you not understand these things?  11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know,  and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.  12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?\n88. Who will continue his work after he has been taken up into Heaven? John 16:13\n>But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.\n89. Pray asking God to fill you with the Spirit of truth.\n> Heavenly Father, thank you for sending down the Spirit of truth. I receive your Spirit of truth who will guide me into all the truth and show me things to come, in the name of Jesus.\n90. How do you know that the spirit you have received is from God?  Matthew 7:9-11\n> 9 “Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?  10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?  11 If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts  to those who ask him!\n91. While on earth why did Christ call himself the Son of Man? Matthew 8:20\n> “And Jesus said to him, ‘Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’”\n92. Is human experience already in God from the beginning, or is human experience obtained by living like a human?\n93. Did Christ rule over our universe after creating it, or did he wait until he had first put on human nature, thereby becoming both Son of God and Son of Man? Matthew 28:16-18\n> 16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.  17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.  18 Then Jesus came to them and said,  “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\n94. Who gave Christ all authority?\n95. What did Christ have after his resurrection, that he did not have before his crucifixion? Matthew 28:18\n> 18 Then Jesus came to them and said,  “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\n96. What could go wrong if Christ ruled our universe after creating it, without first putting on human nature?\n97. What can go wrong when you try advancing a child when you have never been a child before?\n98. In Matthew 23:11 why does the Father (through Christ) say\n> The greatest among you must be a servant.\n99. Would Christ use his authority over Man, fairly, if he had not first obtained a human experience, and known what it was like to be human? Luke 23:34, Luke 5:21-22\n> Luke 23:34\n> Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.\n> \n> Luke 5:21-22\n> 21 The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”\n>22 Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked,  “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?\n100. If God himself goes through the proper way to assume authority, should humans also learn to do things the proper way?\n101. Did Christ live his life on earth by seeking the will of the Father and doing it? John 6:38\n> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.\n102. Should humans also spend their lives seeking the will of God and doing it?\n103. Was Christ able to fulfill the law? Matthew 5:17\n>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\n104. Is Christ able to help you fulfill the law as well?\n105. Pray to thank God for sending his son Jesus Christ.\n",

John 14:16-17\n> 16 I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, who will stay with you forever. 17 He is the Spirit, who reveals the truth about God. The world cannot receive him, because it cannot see him or know him. But you know him, because he remains with you and is in you.\n2. Which kind of people cannot receive the Holy Spirit?\n3. Why can't the people of the world receive the Holy Spirit?\n4. Will the Holy Spirit ever leave you after you have received him?\n5. In what ways will the Holy Spirit help you? John 16:13, John 14:26, Acts 1:8\n> John 16:13\n> But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.\n>\n>John 14:26\n>26 The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and make you remember all that I have told you.\n>\n>Acts 1:8\n>8 But when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will be filled with power, and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, in all of Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”\n6.  Is the Holy Spirit a person, a thing, or a dove?\n7. If Christ did not ascend into Heaven, would the Holy Spirit be sent to earth? John 16:7\n> 7 But I am telling you the truth: it is better for you that I go away, because if I do not go, the Helper will not come to you. But if I do go away, then I will send him to you.\n8. Can you live the life of Christ without the Holy Spirit?\n9. Will God give you the Holy Spirit if you ask? Luke 11:9-13\n> 9 “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you;  seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.  10 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.\n>11 “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?  12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?  13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”\n10. Do you wish to receive the Holy Spirit?\n11. What happened to the disciples on the day of Pentecost?  Acts 2:1-4\n> 2 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.  2 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.  3 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.  4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.\n12. Has the Holy Spirit been sent down on earth?\n13. When was the Holy Spirit sent down on earth?\n14. When the disciples received the Holy Spirit what was the first thing they did? \n15. When you receive the Holy Spirit will there be a visible sign?\n16. When you receive the Holy Spirit will you also be able to speak in other tongues?\n17. Does speaking in tongues align your will with the will of God?\n18. Pray and thank God for the gift of the Holy Spirit. \n19. Since the Holy Spirit has already been sent down, you only have to ask the Holy Spirit to come and fill you in Jesus' name. After praying, open your mouth and speak whatever language the Spirit lets you speak.\n20. In what way does John the Baptist baptize? Matthew 3:11\n> 11 I baptize you with water to show that you have repented, but the one who will come after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. He is much greater than I am; and I am not good enough even to carry his sandals.\n21. In what way does Jesus Christ baptize?\n22. Which baptism is greater?\n23. Speak in tongues as often as you can and follow the leadings of the Spirit.\n",

What are some uses of wheat?\n5. Have you seen a weed before?\n6. Pull out a weed from around you and show it to your instructor.\n7. Can you cook a weed and eat it?\n8. When a weed grows around a tomato plant, will the tomato grow properly and be colorful?\n9. What is the reason for your answer?\n10. What do we do with weeds?\n11. When a weed grows around a plant that you intend to eat, what do you do with it?\n12. What is the parable of the Wheat and the Weeds? Matthew 13:24-30\n> 24 Jesus told them another parable:  “The kingdom of heaven is like  a man who sowed good seed in his field.  25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.  26 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.\n>\n>27 “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’\n>\n>28 “‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.\n>\n>“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’\n>\n>29 “‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.  30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”\n13. If you plant a good seed, can it grow into a bad tree?\n14. Can a tomato grow into a banana tree?\n15. From the parable, how did the man know that an enemy had planted weeds in his field?\n16. In verse 29, why did the man not want the servants to remove the weeds?\n17. Do the weeds and the wheat look very much alike?\n18. Why will the servants accidentally pull out the wheat?\n19. From this parable, who is the man who planted the good seeds?\n20. What are the good seeds?\n21. Who are the servants?\n22. Who is the enemy who planted the weeds?\n23. What are the weeds?\n24. What does the field represent?\n25. In verse 30, what will happen to the weeds?\n26. How does Christ explain the parable of the wheat and the weeds? Matthew 13:37-43\n> 37 He answered,  “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.  38 The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,  39 and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest  is the end of the age,  and the harvesters are angels.\n>\n>40 “As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.  41 The Son of Man  will send out his angels,  and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.  42 They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun  in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\n27. Is a human being a seed?\n28. What is the reason for your answer?\n29. From the explanation above, who is the man who planted the good seeds?\n30. What are the good seeds?\n31. Who are the servants?\n32. Who is the enemy who planted the weeds?\n33. What are the weeds?\n34. What does the field represent?\n35. Are all humans put here by Christ?\n36. Who are the two kinds of humans in this world?\n37. Do the children of the Devil and the children of God look alike at the beginning when they are born?\n38. What are some things that the child of the Devil will do to expose who they are?\n39. Did all the teachings of Christ stop Judas Iscariot from betraying him?\n40. What are the fruits of the seeds of God, when they are fed with the word of God?\n41. In the end, what will happen to every human who was not put here by Christ?\n42. What will the children of the Devil attempt to do to the seeds that were put here by Christ?\n43. Is life on earth going to be easy for the children of God, as long as the children of the Devil remain on earth?\n44. Does being a child of God mean that you automatically accept God as your father?\n45. Pray to God, accept him as your father, and ask him to take you as his child and make you what he wishes to make of you.\n46. What does a sword do? Matthew 10:34\n>34 “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\n",

Matthew 13:31-32\n> 31 Jesus told them another parable: “The Kingdom of heaven is like this. A man takes a mustard seed and sows it in his field. 32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows up, it is the biggest of all plants. It becomes a tree, so that birds come and make their nests in its branches.”\n3. What is the meaning of the parable? \n4. When the word of God is taught to the child of the kingdom who appears little or insignificant, and they practice it, are they able to grow up to become mighty like the mustard seed, and do far better than the seeds of the enemy who may appear bigger and more intelligent in the beginning? \n5. Can the children of the devil be so transformed by the word of God that they grow to become mighty like the mustard seed?\n6. When teaching the word of God, should you look down on those who are little, can barely speak up, and struggle to understand what you are teaching?\n7. What is the meaning of Matthew 13:33?\n> 33 Jesus told them still another parable: “The Kingdom of heaven is like this. A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour until the whole batch of dough rises.”\n8. What is the flour?\n9. What does the yeast represent?\n10. If you wish to grow as a child of God, what do you have to do?\n11. How long have these things been kept secret from mankind? Matthew 13:34-35\n> 34 Jesus used parables to tell all these things to the crowds; he would not say a thing to them without using a parable. 35 He did this to make come true what the prophet had said,\n“I will use parables when I speak to them;  \nI will tell them things unknown since the creation of the world.”\n12. What is the parable of the fishing net? Matthew 13:47-50\n> 47 “Also, the Kingdom of heaven is like this. Some fishermen throw their net out in the lake and catch all kinds of fish. 48 When the net is full, they pull it to shore and sit down to divide the fish: the good ones go into the buckets, the worthless ones are thrown away. 49 It will be like this at the end of the age: the angels will go out and gather up the evil people from among the good 50 and will throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will cry and gnash their teeth.\n13. What is the meaning of the parable?\n14. Is Christ looking for all humans or only those who belong in the kingdom?\n15. When you are teaching the word of God, should you be in a hurry to separate the good seeds from the bad seeds, or first gather all the people that you can, teach them, treat them equally, and let them eventually set themselves apart?\n16. What does it mean to despise a little child who belongs in the kingdom? Matthew 18:10\n> 10 “See that you don't despise any of these little ones. Their angels in heaven, I tell you, are always in the presence of my Father in heaven.\n17. Should you treat a little child as if they were nothing because they are little?\n18. What do their angels do before the Father in his presence?\n19. Are their angels able to carry out instructions from the Father on their behalf?\n20. What is the parable of the lost sheep? Matthew 18:12-14\n> 12 “What do you think a man does who has one hundred sheep and one of them gets lost? He will leave the other ninety-nine grazing on the hillside and go and look for the lost sheep. 13 When he finds it, I tell you, he feels far happier over this one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost. 14 In just the same way your Father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to be lost.\n21. Does the shepherd go looking for a sheep that did not originally belong to them?\n22. Did the children of God belong to the Father from the beginning?\n23. Does the Father treat his children as numbers, or as only begotten?\n24. What does it mean to be an only-begotten child, when you have many siblings?\n25. When the Father loses you to the lies and deceit of the Devil, will he continue to be happy because he has many other children, or he will be sad and do whatever he can to get you back?\n26. Does the Father love each of his children as if they were his only child?\n\n\n",

Read Isaiah 6:1-4\n> 6 In the year that  King Uzziah died I  saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.  2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.  3 And one called to another and said:\n> \n> “Holy, holy, holy is the  Lord  of hosts;   the whole earth is full of his glory!”\n> \n> 4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.  \n3. If you were prophet Isaiah and you saw this vision of God sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, what would this tell you about God?\n4. Is God a king?\n5. Is God Holy?\n6. If God is a king then how should we conduct ourselves before him?\n7. Where did the train of God's robe or garment fill?\n8. Does God live in temples?\n9. Is your body God's temple?\n10. What is the reason for your answer?\n11. How should you treat your body if it is a temple of God?\n12. Should you think carelessly?\n13. Should you speak anyhow?\n14. Should you dress anyhow, or dress majestically like God?\n15. Should you be profane?\n16. In verse 5, why did prophet Isaiah feel the way he did?\n> 5 And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”\n17. In verse 6, why did the seraphim touch prophet Isaiah's mouth with the burning coal?\n> 6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.  7 And he  touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”\n18. Was God the one who told the prophet Isaiah that he was unclean?\n19. How did the prophet Isaiah know that he was unclean?\n20. What happened to his guilt after his sins were atoned for?\n21. When we wish to speak with God, should we go straight to the point or should we start with thanksgiving, praises, and adoration? Psalm 100:4\n> Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.\n22. Give thanks for 10 things that God has done for you. \n23. Give God praises and adoration.\n",

Jeremiah 2:5\n> This is what the LORD says: “What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves.\n2. Is it God's nature to share all he has, including Himself?\n3. Who first had life and chose to share that life with his children?\n4. In what way does God share himself with his children?\n5. Who planted the Garden of Eden?\n6. Is God a gardener and someone who loves nature and beautiful flowers and loves to care for them?\n7. Is God gentle, sensitive, and also thoughtful? Genesis 2:21\n> 21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;\n8. Did God create Adam before creating his food, or his food before creating Adam?\n9. Is God orderly, and does he follow a process to get things done?\n10. Does God like to do excellent things and pay attention to details? Exodus 31:1-5\n> Then the  Lord said to Moses,  2 “See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur,  of the tribe of Judah,  3 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—  4 to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,  5 to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts.\n11. Is God majestic and also a King? \n12. Will the worshipper of God Most High also become majestic like a king, gentle, caring, sensitive, orderly, thoughtful, sharing, etc?\n13. Does God want you to worship him because someone asked you to, or because you understand why you worship?\n14. What is intelligent worship?\n15. Are there *worshippers* and *true worshipers*? John 4:21-23\n> 21 “Woman,”  Jesus replied,  “believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.  22 You Samaritans worship what you do not know;  we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.  23 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.\n16. Does God want to be worshipped by people who have been born in the spirit?\n17. Does God want to be worshipped by people who have been born *once*, or does God want to be worshipped by people who have been born *twice*?\n18. Does God want to be wirshipped as he *truly* is, or as we *think* he is?\n19. Is God *big* or God is *infinite*, *limitless*?\n20. If a worshipper describes God as _big_, are they not, in doing so, imposing a limit on the limitless?\n21. Does true worship ask God for *things* during worship?\n22. Is true worship *intelligent*?\n23. Does God choose how he is to be worshipped, or does man choose how he wishes to worship God? Genesis 4:3-7\n> 3 In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering  to the  Lord.  4 And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions  from some of the firstborn of his flock.  The  Lord  looked with favor on Abel and his offering,  5 but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.\n>\n>6 Then the  Lord  said to Cain, “Why are you angry?  Why is your face downcast?  7 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door;  it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”\n24. What kind of energy do you receive from God when you worship him with spiritual songs?\n25. Does spiritual energy help you go through the difficulties of life?\n26. Does spiritual energy make you sensitive to the spirit?\n27. Do you know that your body is a temple and God lives in you?\n28. What should you do to feel the presence of God within you?\n29. Does God expect you to worship more than you pray or pray more than you worship?\n30. What is the reason for your answer?\n31. Name a song you can use to worship God each morning when you wake up before you start your day.\n32. Close your eyes and picture God sitting on his throne, high and lifted up, worship God with the song [We Give You Glory Lord As We Honour You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7gvxW42K7w&pp=ygUZa2FobGVobyB5b3UgYXJlIHdvbmRlcmZ1bA%3D%3D \"KALEHO - We Give You Glory Lord As We Honour You (You are Wonderful) ft.

Point out something that you do not like about your friend and correct them.\n14. Can you make friends when you are not friendly yourself?\n15. Is God able to work in connection with his ministering angels and spiritual agencies to connect two individuals who must join together in a friendship?\n16. Who do angels take their instructions from? Psalm 91:11-12\n> For he will command his angels  concerning you  \nto guard you in all your ways;  \n>12 they will lift you up in their hands,  \nso that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\n17. How do we show God that we appreciate the friends that he has given us?\n18. Practice this with your friends: \n\t- When going out with your friends, only do what you *all* agree on\n\t- Avoid doing anything that at least one of you disagrees with\n",

When a tree starts to grow and become bent, how do you make it grow straight?\n5. Can the stick make the tree straight when it is itself bent?\n6. When the tree is already grown, and it is bent, can you make it straight?\n7. When is the best time to make a tree straight?\n8. When a little tree has been made straight, will it ever get bent again?\n9. Do you know that you are a little bent tree?\n10. When you still insult other people, are you straight?\n11. When you still disobey your teachers, are you straight?\n12. When you hide things from your parents, are you straight?\n13. What can go wrong when you hide things from your parents?\n14. In this story, why did I lose my leg?\n> My mom warned me not to climb trees when I went to school. She said that if she found out I had climbed a tree, I would be punished. But as soon as I got to school, I climbed a tree anyway. The branch broke, and I fell, breaking my leg. I didn't tell my teachers or my parents about the injury and tried to hide it.\n>\n>After a week, my parents noticed a terrible smell in the house, like something rotting. They searched for the source of the smell and eventually discovered it was my leg, which had started to fester. They rushed me to the hospital. The doctor said if they had brought me in right after the accident, my leg could have healed. But now, they had to either cut off my leg or risk the infection spreading to the rest of my body. I decided to have my leg amputated, and the doctor performed the surgery.\n15. What would be the most likely outcome of this story and what will happen to my parent's trust?\n> My friend gave me a phone and asked me to hide it at my house. She told me not to tell anyone, so I didn't. A short time later, the police came knocking at my door, asking about a stolen phone. My parents, trusting that I wouldn't do anything like that, kept insisting that I hadn't hidden any phone in the house. The police insisted on searching the house anyway, and it didn't take long for them to find the phone.\n16. Why do you hide things from your parents and teachers?\n17. When is the best time for you to become straight?\n18. If you are the little bent tree, who is the stick working to make you straight?\n19. Can the people who work to make you straight, succeed when they are not straight themselves?\n20. Write down 4 ways God works to make you straight.\n21. Write down 4 ways your parents work to make you straight.\n22. Write down 4 ways your teachers work to make you straight.\n23. What will happen to you when you do not allow yourself to be made straight by God, your teachers, parents, etc.?\n24. Every weekend, hold your mother's hands and pray for her.\n25. Repeat the same for your father.\n26. Start your Quiet Time. Each morning you wake up earlier than you usually do, and do a few things:\n\t- Sing a worship song to God. Singing worship songs transforms you from the inside, makes you spiritually sensitive, and allows you to feel God's presence in you.\n\t-  You say a prayer\n\t- Read a portion of scripture. You can start with the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) before reading Proverbs, Psalms, and the others.\n\t-  Meditate on what you have read and think about ways in which you can apply it. For instance, if Christ said that we shall be judged by every single word that we speak, I will start by repenting from every foul word I have ever spoken and be determined to speak only good words from now on.\n\t- God will begin to speak with you. Do as he says.\n\t- God loves consistency\n27. Share with your parents and teachers, everything you have been hiding from them. \n\n\n",

The doctor said if they had brought me in right after the accident, my leg could have healed. But now, they had to either cut off my leg or risk the infection spreading to the rest of my body.

For instance, if Christ said that we shall be judged by every single word that we speak, I will start by repenting from every foul word I have ever spoken and be determined to speak only good words from now on.\n- God will begin to speak with you.

What did Moses tell the children of Israel about the promised land? Exodus 3:8\n> 8 So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.\n3. Have you seen a piece of land that is flowing with milk and honey?\n4. Will arriving at a specific location make your life better?\n5. What did Moses teach the children of Israel every day, on their way to the promised land?\n6. Did the children of Israel complain?\n7. What did they complain about?\n8. Did they learn the lessons that Moses taught them?\n9. Did they obey God's instructions?\n10. What is the nearest city around you?\n11. If you were traveling by foot to the nearest city, how long would it take you to arrive?\n12. How long did the children of Israel travel in the wilderness?\n13. Did they make it to the promised land? Joshua 5:6\n>  For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people who were men of war, who came out of Egypt, were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord. Unto these the Lord swore that He would not show them the land which the Lord swore unto their fathers that He would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.\n14. If you were alone in the house with plenty of foodstuffs but no food, and you were feeling hungry but did not know how to cook, will you starve or not?\n15. Will you starve because there is no foodstuff in the house?\n16. Why will you starve?\n17. Is the promised land a physical location?\n18. Is the promised land in you or outside you?\n19. If the promised land is in you, who are the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites?\n20. Can your legs take you to the promised land?\n21. What will happen to you when you try to go to the promised land on foot?\n22. How do you arrive at the promised land?\n23. How did Moses intend to take the children of Israel to the promised land?\n24. Why did the children of Israel fail to make it to the promised land?\n25. Can you reach the promised land without changing the way you think?\n26. Can you reach the promised land without changing your attitude?\n27. Does God want to give you himself, or all the food in the world?\n28. Does God want to give you himself, or all the lands of the world?\n29. If you do not *think* like God, are you at the promised land?\n30. If you do not *speak* like God are you at the promised land?\n31. If you do not *act* like God, are you at the promised land?\n32. How will you know when you have arrived at the promised land?\n33. Will you lack when you reach the promised land?\n34. Will you make the wrong choices when you reach the promised land?\n35. When you have reached the promised land, will you succeed no matter where you find yourself?\n36. When you do not allow God to take you to the promised land, in what ways can a task that should take you a day, take you 40 years, and you will still not be able to complete it?\n37. Are you at the promised land?\n38. How will you get to the promised land?\n",

                    "markdown": "# They Take No Prisoners\n\n\n\nIn the days before mercy was ever spoken of, men lived by the law of blood and vengeance. If one tribe wronged another, the answer was simple: gather the strongest warriors, sharpen the spears, and march at dawn. They would burn huts, slay men, take women, and crush every sign that the other tribe ever existed. No survivors. No prisoners. Mercy was a word unborn.\n\nTo them, justice was destruction — swift, total, unquestioned. The old songs celebrated it. Warriors were praised not for their restraint, but for how thoroughly they erased their enemies. When rage filled their hearts, it became a river that drowned reason. The smoke that rose from burnt villages was their victory song.\n\nThen, somewhere between the ashes of vengeance and the bones of the fallen, a man appeared. He was not a warrior, nor did he carry a sword. He carried only words — words about a God who forgave. A God who, even when wronged, opened His hand instead of His fist.\n\n“Blessed are the merciful,” he said, “for they shall obtain mercy.”\n\nThe people laughed at first. What warrior wanted to be blessed for sparing his enemy? What tribe wanted to leave survivors who might one day return for revenge? But his words began to spread, soft as wind yet heavy with truth.\n\nHe told stories of a Father who forgives His enemies, who restrains His power though He could destroy with a word. He said strength is not in killing, but in sparing. To fight when provoked is natural; to forgive when wounded is divine. Slowly, those words found soil in human hearts.\n\nCenturies passed. The world changed. Nations rose and fell, and the idea of mercy began to shape them. Taking prisoners, once unthinkable, became a sign of progress — a mark of civilization. Wars still came, but some enemies were now fed, not slaughtered. The greatest victory was no longer total annihilation, but restraint.\n\nStill, the old instinct sometimes stirs. I saw it one afternoon while teaching children about God in a dusty community classroom. Two girls quarreled over a skipping rope. One raised her fist and struck the other again and again — wild, relentless, and **without even looking at her opponent**. Her eyes were fixed somewhere beyond the moment, clouded with blind anger. She didn’t care if the other girl was hurt, bleeding, or crying. She kept swinging, refusing to even _see_ the one she was hurting. Mercy had left the room.\n\nFor a moment, I saw in that small fight the echo of ancient wars — how easily the heart returns to the law of destruction. Rage blinds; it silences compassion.\n\nWhen I separated them, the furious girl stood panting, tears streaking her face. I asked her, “Why didn’t you stop when she said sorry?”\n\nShe looked confused, almost startled, as if she hadn’t heard me. In her silence, I saw how natural vengeance feels to the human heart — and how unnatural mercy must be taught, again and again.\n\nTaking prisoners — the act of stopping before total destruction — is more than a political practice. It’s a moral awakening. It means recognizing that even when you have the power to destroy, you choose not to. That choice, repeated through history, has kept humanity from consuming itself.\n\nThe tribes of old took no prisoners because they saw no value in mercy. But we, who have heard of mercy and still refuse it, are worse. Civilization is not the absence of war — it’s the presence of restraint.\n\nWhen you take no prisoners, you destroy your enemy.  \nWhen you take prisoners, you save yourself.\n",

Can what belongs to you, be taken away from you?\n4. Can you defend what belongs to you, against *anyone* who will try to take it away from you?\n5. Does it belong to you, forever?\n6. If what belongs to you, does not belong to you forever, and a person who was stronger than you could take it away from you, does it *truly* belong to you?\n7. What are some things that belong to you that can be taken away from you, and do not belong to you forever?\n8. What are some things that belong to you forever, and cannot be taken away from you, even if the person was more powerful than you?\n9. What is the story of Jesus, Mary, and Martha? Luke 10:38-42\n>38 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.  39 She had a sister called Mary,  who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said.  40 But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”\n>41 “Martha, Martha,”  the Lord answered,  “you are worried and upset about many things,  42 but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”\n10. What was the reason for Christ's answer to Martha? Luke 10:42\n> ...but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.\n11. When do you say that something truly belongs to you?\n12. Can your knowledge of God be taken away from you?\n13. Can your valuable memories be taken away from you?\n14. Can the content of your Character, which is Godlike, be taken away from you?\n15. Can your Godlike personality be taken away from you?\n16. Which is more important, the things that belong to you that can be taken away from you, or the things that belong to you that *cannot* be taken away from you?\n17. Do you keep the things that cannot be taken away from you, in you, or outside you?\n18. Are the things that cannot be taken away from you, visible or invisible?\n19. Which is more important, the things that belong to you that cannot be seen, or the things that belong to you that can be seen? \n20. Which is more important, the things that belong to you that are in you, or the things that belong to you that are outside you? \n21. Who protects the treasures in you from the people who will try to take them away from you?\n22. What is a treasure?\n23. What are some things that people treasure in this world? \n24. Can these treasures be taken away from them or not?\n25. Which kind of treasures should you spend every day of your life finding and collecting?\n26. If your treasures are the contents of your mind that have eternal value, the Godly content of your heart, then what is the jar of clay?\n27. Which treasures do you wish to collect into your jar of clay?\n28. How do you collect treasures into your jar of clay?\n29. If your life is not measured by how much you own, then what is your life measured by? Luke 12:15\n> Beware! Guard against every kind of greed. Life is not measured by how much you own.\n30. Can you be rich yet poor? Revelation 3:17\n> You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.\n31. How can you be rich yet poor?\n32. Can you be clothed, yet naked?\n33. How can you be clothed, yet naked?\n34. Can you be healthy, yet sick?\n35. How can you be healthy, yet sick?\n36. Why did Christ call the rich man a fool? Luke 12:13-21\n> 13 A man in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide with me the property our father left us.”\n>\n>14 Jesus answered him, “Friend, who gave me the right to judge or to divide the property between you two?” 15 And he went on to say to them all, “Watch out and guard yourselves from every kind of greed; because your true life is not made up of the things you own, no matter how rich you may be.”\n>\n>16 Then Jesus told them this parable: “There was once a rich man who had land which bore good crops. 17 He began to think to himself, ‘I don't have a place to keep all my crops. What can I do? 18 This is what I will do,’ he told himself; ‘I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, where I will store the grain and all my other goods. 19 Then I will say to myself, Lucky man! You have all the good things you need for many years. Take life easy, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself!’ 20 But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night you will have to give up your life; then who will get all these things you have kept for yourself?’”\n>\n>21 And Jesus concluded, “This is how it is with those who pile up riches for themselves but are not rich in God's sight.”\n37. What will God do when your jar of clay is full of good treasures?\n",

People enjoy drama and mayhem.  \nSoft news sells nothing, puts people to sleep.  \nI no longer feel guilty for not watching.  \nI don’t go slow to see the car wreck, and am trying hard not to gossip.  \nI’m staying in my own business.  \nWho am I, to poke around in yours?\n\nLife seems much simpler now.  \nKinder. Honest. Peaceful.  \nI don’t do things to *make* me happy (but if doing them makes me unhappy, why keep doing them?), but make decisions based on merit.  \nIf it’s worth doing, if there’s benefit, I do it and I am happy (if I fail to do it well and it seems worth it, I try harder, work longer, get advice and do it better.  \nIf I see that I’m not suited, no matter the effort, I turn it over to those more capable. No shame. No judgment).  \nWhen I leave this life, I want to be translucent.  \nI want to Love so well, so deeply, there simply isn’t another choice.\n"
