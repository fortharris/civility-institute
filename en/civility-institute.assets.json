When you go to work each day, for a month, work hard, and your employer refuses to pay you at the end of the month, how would you feel?\n2. When you do not work for a month and receive no payment at the end of the month, how would you feel?\n3. Do you draw the same *meaning* from the different ways you are treated?\n4. Give examples of different ways you can be treated and the meanings you may draw from them.\n5. Can different people draw different meanings from the *same* treatment?\n6. Give examples of how different people may draw different meanings from the *same* treatment.\n7. If you came across a poor person and offered them money, what possible meanings can they draw from it?\n8. Is it possible for them to perceive it as a trick, that you will probably want something in return later on?\n9. Is it possible for them to perceive it as showing off to everyone that you have money?\n10. Is it possible for them to perceive it as you thinking that you can solve everyone's problem?\n11. Is it possible for them to perceive it also as an act of love?\n12. If you shared candies with a little child, would the child most likely perceive the treatment as love?\n13. Will they still perceive the treatment as love if you kept sharing candies with this child until eventually, they lose all their teeth?\n14. When they grow up and realize that they no longer have a perfect set of teeth, they cannot bite into most meals, and people are laughing at them, and you are the one to blame for it, will they continue to perceive your treatment as love?\n15. Is love a form of meaning drawn from a treatment from another person?\n16. Can a treatment that one person perceives as love, be perceived as another thing by another person?\n17. When you come across your child disrespecting an elderly person and you drag them into the house and scold them, what meaning will the child draw from your actions?\n18. Will the child perceive that you probably do not love them?\n19. When the child grows up to discover the benefit of treating adults with respect after your scolding has straightened them, how will they perceive your scolding?\n20. Will the child continue to perceive your treatment as hatred now that they are older?\n21. How will they perceive your scolding now that they are older and have started reaping the benefits of respecting adults?\n22.  What are some treatments that are always perceived as love, no matter who is receiving it?\n",

Read the story and recite it the way you remember it:\n> When I was a kid, my mom often took me along on her trips. We spent a lot of time together, and she would buy me many gifts. But something odd always happened when we got back home. After getting off the bus, we would often meet one of my aunts. This aunt liked to talk a lot and would stop my mom for a long chat. She talked about her problems at home, church, school, and other random stuff. My aunt did most of the talking while my mom, who seemed to forget I was there, just listened and added a few words now and then. I would get bored, tired of waiting, and walk the rest of the way home by myself.\n>\n> One day, when I was a bit older, I asked my mom why she always ignored me and talked with my aunt for so long when we came back from our trips. She smiled and explained something surprising. My mom told me that my aunt was married to a man who never talked to her. She kept a lot of things inside and only felt better when she talked to my mom. My mom wanted to show her love by giving my aunt all her attention and listening to her, no matter where they met – at church, on the road, or at home.\n>\n>Hearing this, I felt sorry for getting angry and walking away from them. I understood my aunt better and decided to visit her regularly and listen to all her stories, even if they seemed boring to me.\n2.

Did your mum understand your Aunt by asking questions about your Aunt's private life, or did your Aunt most likely bring it up in one of her lengthy conversations?\n4.

When you share a gift with your neighbor and experience the joy of sharing, are you more likely to share even more next time?\n2. Does love grow?\n3. Where do you sow the seed of love?\n4. How do you make your love grow?\n5. When you teach an individual, for free, is the individual also more likely to teach others for free?\n6. Can someone who does not love, on receiving love from you, consider showing love for others?\n7. Does love spread?\n8. When you wear a smile and wave at a child, how is the child most likely to respond?\n9. How do you make your love spread, even to the ends of the earth?\n10. When you have a neighbor who does not like you, and you minister love to them, are they likely to change their mind about you, and even change their attitude towards you?\n11. On learning that Christ was willing to live amongst men in order to teach them the ways of the Father, knowing that he will suffer horrible things and lose his own life, do you intend to live his message and be changed by it, or rather, reject it?\n12. Does love change the individual receiving the love?\n13. In what ways can love change the individual?\n14. In what ways can love change even the most unrepentant sinner?\n15. When you minister love to a wayward child, and your love never falters, is the child likely to reach a point in their lives where they begin to consider how their actions will affect you, and most likely make the right choices in order not to disappoint you?\n16. Would you like to disappoint your parents after all the love they have ministered to you?\n17. Would you like to disappoint your teachers after all that they have taught you?\n18. Would you like to disappoint the Father after all the love he has ministered to you?\n19. Does love serve as a guide and make us follow the right path?\n20. In what ways can love guide an individual, and help them to walk the right path?\n21. When you have given an individual a piece of yourself, does your word carry more weight with that individual, and makes them more likely to do what you tell them to do?\n22. Should we use love to help each other to grow, or rather, influence others to do the wrong things?\n",

There was a small bump on the road meant to slow down cars.\n> \n> When I hit the bump, my bike flew up! The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital. I was surrounded by a doctor, nurses, and a familiar face. I recognized him as the man who worked at an electronics store near where I was riding my bike.\n> \n> He explained what had happened. After my bike hit the bump, I fell and fainted in the middle of the road. He remembered me because I always smiled and said hi whenever I passed by. He and his friend couldn't leave me there, so they quickly stopped a taxi and took me to the hospital.\n2. What could have happened to you if you were left alone in the middle of the road?\n3.

Was it your expensive bike, clothes, or phone that saved you?\n8. Was it your parents that came to your rescue?\n9. Who took you to the hospital?\n10. Was it your rich parent's maid or personal assistants who found you and took you to the hospital?\n11. Who saved you?\n12.

I recognized him as the man who worked at an electronics store near where I was riding my bike.\n> \n> He explained what had happened.

Do you know the difference between right and wrong?\n4. Are you able to learn?\n5. Does the spirit of the Father live in you?\n6. When you grow to a stage where you now know the difference between right and wrong, good and bad, are you able to choose between right and wrong?\n7. Are you able to learn?\n8. Does the spirit of the Father come to live in you?\n9. Do you start taking steps with God?\n10. Why is every step that you take with God called a spirit victory? \n11. When you take steps with God until you become one with God, do you and the Father have the same will?\n12. Do you like the things that the Father likes?\n13. Do you dislike the things that the Father also dislikes?\n14. Do you and God think, speak, and act alike?\n15. What did Christ say about himself and the Father when he reached this stage?\n16. Are you now under *grace*?\n17. Will you willfully disobey the Father?\n18. Do you receive anything that you ask the Father?\n19. Why do you receive anything that you ask the Father?\n20. When you learn from your teacher, do you set questions for yourself, answer the questions, and then tell yourself that you have passed?\n21. How would you know that you and the Father have now become one?\n22. Will you have any doubts that you are truly a child of the Father when the Father confirms you himself?\n23. Do you want the Father to confirm you, or do you want other humans to confirm you?\n24. When your spirit is mature, are you able to ascend into the Heavens without first sleeping?\n25. When your spirit is mature, are you able to grow to old age because God needs you around to put the good in you into others, you sleep, and then you ascend into the Heavens\n26. Which individuals were translated into Heaven without first sleeping?\n27. What happens to the spirit of the Father in you, when you fail to ascend?\n28. If a reason must be given on behalf of each individual who fails to ascend, why they failed to ascend, should we do what we can to help each other to grow, or rather, discourage them?\n29. What are some things that you can do to help other people to grow, and be able to ascend?\n30. Which stage are you in now?\n31. How do you get to the next stage?\n\n",

What does God expect from every man?\n4. Is it possible to become perfect?\n5. Is it possible to become like God?\n6. What does it mean to be perfect?\n7. Are you perfect when you are not respectful?\n8. Are you perfect when you are not kind?\n9. If you wish to become like someone, what do you have to do?\n10. How does a man become perfect like God?\n11. Read **Psalm 82** twice.\n> 1 God presides in the great assembly;  \nhe renders judgment  among the “gods”:\n>\n> 2 “How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked? \n> 3 Defend the weak and the fatherless;  uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.   \n> 4 Rescue the weak and the needy;   deliver them from the hand of the wicked.\n> \n> 5 “The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness;   all the foundations of the earth are shaken.\n> \n> 6 “I said, ‘You are “gods”;   you are all sons of the Most High.’   \n> 7 But you will die  like mere mortals;   you will fall like every other ruler.”\n> \n> 8 Rise up,  O God, judge the earth,   for all the nations are your inheritance.\n12. What is judgment?\n13. Which people have gathered?\n14. Who is leading the gathering?\n15. In verse 2, what are the gods doing wrong?\n16. What does God expect from the gods in verse 3?\n17. What does God expect from the gods in verse 4?\n18. Who is the Most High in verse 6?\n19. Why does God have to remind the gods that \"I said, ‘You are “gods”; you are all sons of the Most High?\"\n20. Read  **John 10:30-36**.\n> 30 I and the Father are one.”\n> \n> 31 Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him,  32 but Jesus said to them,  “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?”\n> \n> 33 “We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.”\n> \n> 34 Jesus answered them,  “Is it not written in your Law,  ‘I have said you are “gods”’?  35 If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—  36 what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world?  Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?\n21. In verse 33, why did the Jews try to stone Jesus?\n22. What is blasphemy?\n23. In verse 34, which part of the bible was Jesus referring to?\n24. In verse 35, who are the gods?\n25. Read  Psalm 82 again\n26. In verse 5, Why does God say that \"The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing...?\"\n27. Do the gods know that they are gods?\n28. Do the gods know that they are all sons of the Most High, and can become like God?\n29. What happens to you when you walk in a place without light?\n30. When do we say that a person is living in darkness?\n31. In verse 5, why does God say that the gods walk about in darkness?\n32. Is the earth a school?\n33. What is the purpose of a school?\n34. What are the gods supposed to learn before they leave the earth?\n35. When a person walks into a school and comes out worse than they entered it, is the school serving its purpose?\n36. When all the people who walk into a school, come out worse than they entered it, and bad has now become good, is the school serving its purpose?\n37. Why does God say that the earth has gone out of course?\n38. Even though men are children of the Most High, what will happen to them if they do not conduct themselves like sons of God?\n39. Did the Jews understand Psalm 82 at the time of Jesus?\n40. Do the people around you know and understand Psalm 82?\n41. What are you going to do about it?\n42. Read **Numbers 18:20**.\n>  20 The Lord said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites.\n43. *The children of Israel had settled down and divided the lands among themselves. Aaron asks God what his share will be and God tells him that He, God, will be his share and inheritance.*\n44. How does God become your share and your portion?\n45. When you become like God, can you also do the things that God can do?\n46. Do you want God or the things that God has created?\n47. How do you inherit someone?\n48. How do you inherit God, who will not die?\n49. Who received the greatest gift among the children of Israel?\n \n\n\n",

                    "markdown": "# In a Nutshell\nChrist in a Nutshell\n\nTo really get who Christ is, you need to understand the Trinity. John explains it best in John 1.\n\nIn the Old Testament, people only knew about God, but it turns out there are multiple spirit personalities that are also God. Christ is one of them, and He’s actually the creator of the world and everything in it.\n\nGod doesn't exist; He is, and He brings everything into existence. Christ has always existed, even before He came to earth. This confused a lot of people who thought they knew all about His birth and family. John 8:48-59.\n\nChrist didn’t want people to recognize Him just by His words but wanted them to figure it out through His actions and understanding of the scriptures.\n\nChrist had the power to forgive sins and had been doing so long before His crucifixion. Luke 5:24.\n\nThe whole idea of atonement tries to make sense of His brutal death on the cross. Even so, He told the Jews not to weep for Him as He was about to be crucified because He knew that what would happen to them after His death and resurrection would be worse than dying on the cross. Luke 23:27-28.\n\nBefore His death, Christ said many things that were hard for people to accept. John 11:20-26. He didn’t just have the power to bring people back to life; He is the resurrection. This means that if you become like Christ by following Him through the Holy Spirit, you’ll be like a balloon that won’t sink in water. Even if you get pushed down, you’ll rise again. You’ll never really die; if you’re killed, you’ll come back to life.\n\nMany people thought Christ was possessed, called Him a Samaritan, a madman, and didn’t take Him seriously. He knew that for people to believe, He had to show them a sign. Matthew 12:38-42.\n\nWhen it was time for Him to be crucified, His enemies, including the devil, thought they could humiliate Him. But they didn’t know that the Father planned to use this to glorify the Son and spread His message. Stay with me here.\n\nIf Christ hadn’t died publicly, His resurrection wouldn’t have meant much to anyone. His public humiliation, death on the cross, burial, and resurrection on the third day made it clear to everyone that Christ, the carpenter’s son, was telling the truth. This shook the devil and convinced people who were unsure about His teachings. This is what made Christ's message spread and take root in people’s hearts to the point where they were willing to die for it. Even His disciples didn’t believe it at first and needed proof, like seeing the marks on His palms.\n\nChrist is the key to the Father’s house. He is the way, the truth, and the life. Become like Christ, and you will live. Through Him, more people can become like Christ, and then they can ascend. The Holy Spirit is here to help with that. You can’t live a Christian life without the Holy Spirit. To be like Christ is to have Christ. I can’t stress this enough. Believing in the Son of God means acting on His every word, not just saying you believe. That’s how you become.\n\nThe path is narrow because many people try to find their own way into God’s kingdom without changing themselves.\n\nMatthew 5:48. The only way to become like God is to imitate Him. There’s no other way. Christ is our role model and standard. After taking on human nature, He can now help humans overcome their limitations and reach the Father’s mark of perfection.\n",

No one _is_ good but One, _that is,_ God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”\n>\n> 18 He said to Him, “Which ones?”\n>\n> Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ 19 ‘Honor your father and _your_ mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”\n>\n> 20 The young man said to Him, “All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?”\n>\n> 21 Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”\n>\n> 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.\n\nThe rich young ruler must follow three steps:\n- Follow all the commandments\n- Give all that he has to the poor\n- Follow Christ (for it is by following and imitating God that a man becomes like God)\n",

He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.\n>\n>4 “Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.”\n27. Did David repent or continue in his sin? 2 Samuel 12:13\n> 13 Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned  against the  Lord.”\n>\n>Nathan replied, “The  Lord has taken away your sin.

The  Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering,  5 but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.\n> \n> 6 Then the  Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry?  Why is your face downcast?  7 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted?

It was like a daughter to him.\n>\n>4 “Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.”"

Has the sinner already paid for their sin?\n9. Has the righteous already received the reward of their righteousness? Matthew 19:21\n>Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”\n10. When a person sins or commits evil and God has already judged them, is there a need for other humans to also judge them again, or rather, cure them?\n11. When a person starts sinning, does God punish them immediately, or warn them first? \n12. Should humans also attempt to guide other humans to repentance? Ezekiel 3:18\n> When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.\n13. When a person does something wrong and is later found to have committed evil, what does God expect other humans to do? \n14. When a person does something wrong and is later found to have sinned, what does God expect other humans to do?\n15. Would the person commit evil had they been taught?\n16.

When a person wishes to stop insulting but ends up insulting other people anyway, do they commit sin or evil?\n25. What can you do to cure such a person?\n26. Did the man commit sin or evil?\n> A man sets a trap for an animal in the forest and ends up trapping the leg of an old woman who is almost blind. The old woman eventually dies. \n27. What can you do to cure such a person?\n28. When the man goes to set a trap there again knowing very well that other humans might be passing there, and he traps the leg of a human, did he commit sin or evil?\n29. What can you do to cure such a person?\n30. Did you commit sin or evil?\n> Your friend informs you that her mother beats her in the house every day. You go to her house to talk to the mother with the hope that her mother might stop beating her. Her mother rather gets angry and starts beating her even more. \n31. What might be a possible cure to prevent you from making the same mistake again?\n32. Did the man commit sin or evil?\n> A man wants to build a house. He first has to clear the land so he cuts down a few trees that are growing on the land. After building the house he falls sick and prays to God. God tells him that the medicine that will cure his sickness can only be found in the tree that he had cut whiles building his house. \n33. What can be done to cure him so he does not make the same mistake again?\n34. Give other examples of evil, sin, and iniquity, and how they can be cured.\n\n",

For many false prophets have gone out everywhere. 2 This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit: anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God. 3 But anyone who denies this about Jesus does not have the Spirit from God. The spirit that he has is from the Enemy of Christ; you heard that it would come, and now it is here in the world already.\n57. Pray and ask God to give you the spirit of discernment to be able to tell the difference between spirits.\n",

Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, and they spoke to Jesus about her. 39 He went and stood at her bedside and ordered the fever to leave her. The fever left her, and she got up at once and began to wait on them.\n>40 After sunset all who had friends who were sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus; he placed his hands on every one of them and healed them all.\n11. How do you heal a person who is suffering from a sickness not caused by a demon?\n12. Lay your hand on another person and repeat 10 times.\n> Sickness, leave now in the name of Jesus\n13. Before teaching the word of God to people, should you first sack every unclean spirit out of them?\n14. Deliver yourself from every unclean spirit.\n> I am free from every unclean spirit in the name of Jesus\n15. Deliver yourself from every curse.\n> Lord Jesus, deliver me from every curse and power of the enemy\n16. When forcing out an unclean spirit is proving difficult what else can you do? Mark 5:9\n>9 Then Jesus asked him,  “What is your name?” “My name is Legion,”  he replied, “for we are many.”\n17. Can you force out a demon by first asking their name, and then referring to them by name to come out in the name of Jesus?\n18. How do you make sure that the demon does not enter the person again? Mark 9:25\n> 25 When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” he said, “I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.”\n19. What do you do with thoughts that the devil tries to put in your head? James 4:7\n> Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\n20. How do you resist the devil in your thoughts?\n21. Should you silently ignore these thoughts?\n22. Should you vocally rebuke these thoughts and command them to leave you in the name of Jesus?\n23. Repeat three(3) times:\n> Let every unclean thought depart from me in the name of Jesus\n24. Should you watch what you see with your eyes if you do not want to be troubled by evil spirits?\n25. What is the reason for your answer?\n26. Should you watch what you hear with your ears if you do not want to be troubled by evil spirits?\n27. What is the reason for your answer?\n28. Should you watch what you say with your tongue if you do not want to be troubled by evil spirits?\n29. What is the reason for your answer?\n30. Should you watch what you do with your body if you do not want to have trouble with evil spirits?\n31. What is the reason for your answer?\n32. Should you watch what you bring into your home if you do not want to have trouble with evil spirits? Deuteronomy 7:26\n> Make sure you set fire to their carved gods. Don’t get greedy for the veneer of silver and gold on them and take it for yourselves—you’ll get trapped by it for sure. GOD hates it; it’s an abomination to GOD, your God. And don’t dare bring one of these abominations home or you’ll end up just like it, burned up as a holy destruction. No: It is forbidden! Hate it. Abominate it. Destroy it and preserve GOD’s holiness.\n33. What is the reason for your answer?\n34. Should you have discussions with evil spirits?\n35. Should you entertain evil spirits?\n36. Should you be afraid of evil spirits?\n37. What do you do when you come across an evil spirit?\n38. Are you prepared for warfare?\n\n",

They attach themselves to the individual, bind them and nothing they do can set them free. They are stuck in a cycle of defeat. You will hate what you do each time you do it because there is a pure spirit in you reacting to the bad that you have introduced into your system, but after repenting, you will return to doing it again. Christ calls this demon the strongman.\n\nMark 3:27\n\n> In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. Then  he can plunder the strong man’s house.\n\nFortunately, Christ has given the believer authority over the powers of darkness (yes, they do have power).\n\nLuke 10:19 \n> I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.\n\nMark 16:17-18\n\n> 17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;\n> \n> 18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\n\nThe believer, not God, shall cast out devils. Force the demon out in the name of Jesus. Mark 16:17, Mark 5:8, Mark 9:25. Command the spirit of pornography, [insert sin] to leave you in the name of Jesus and never return.\n\nAfter this give your heart, mind, and body to God. Tell God \"Heavenly Father, I give you my heart, I give you my mind, I give you my body and soul in the name of Jesus.\" Let this be your daily consecration.\n\n",

First, they create a distraction because as long as you're paying attention, they can't take anything. They might notice where you keep your money. If it's in your left pocket, they might tap you on your right shoulder and then sneak their hand into your left pocket to steal your money without you noticing.\n\nThink about a hen. She's usually calm and harmless, but if you try to take one of her chicks or get too close, she'll defend them fiercely. So, if you wanted to steal one of her chicks without a fight, you'd need a distraction.\n\nWhen you're focused on a goal, sometimes you don't notice other important things slipping away. It's like a trick to keep you distracted from what truly matters.\n\nIn the past, a husband and wife would agree on who does what at home. The husband would go to work and earn money, while the wife took care of the house and kids. This way, the kids were always looked after, and any bad behavior was quickly noticed and corrected. The parents could guide their kids' upbringing.\n\nBut then, the wife might hear a little voice saying, \"You're being cheated! You can make as much money as your husband. You're wasting your life at home while he gets to have a career. What if something happens to him? How will you take care of the kids?\"\n\nSo, the wife gets a job and hands over her responsibilities to someone else. While she's busy working, guess who's left vulnerable? The kids, and the one who comes to take advantage of this is the devil.\n\nWhen couples start fighting, it's often because the devil is trying to distract them so he can influence their kids. He's not interested in the husband or wife; his target is the children.\n\nIf a husband suddenly finds other women showing interest in him, he shouldn't think it's because he's become more attractive. Let the husband know that when a snake holds his gaze at a frog, it is not because the frog is handsome or pretty, the snake is just being a snake and frogs are what they eat. It's just a distraction to ruin his family. I asked a young wife who was spying on her husband to gather evidence of cheating: while she was doing that, who was looking after her kids? When she got back, would her kids still be the same?\n\nThink about the hen and her chicks. As long as she's alert, no one can steal her chicks. But if she gets distracted, what then?\n\n",

Wouldn't it be cool to know how angels live in heaven, how they show up on Earth, or how to make them do stuff for you? What about talking to your dead mom? This curiosity makes some people join cults to learn secret things and try to get an edge over others.\n\nBut here's the catch: the leader of these cults is in chains, and the same thing happens to anyone who climbs the ranks. Knowledge without wisdom can mess you up.\n\nIn Revelation 2:24, it says:\n\n> 24 “But the rest of you in Thyatira have not followed this evil teaching; you have not learned what the others call ‘the deep secrets of Satan.’ I say to you that I will not put any other burden on you.\n\nOccult books never use the real names of demons because of Christ. Instead, they use names from the Bible or call them saints. People who read these books often end up messed up. Let God's spirit help you decide what to read and what to avoid.\n\nRemember the Garden of Eden? The devil tricked Adam and Eve with knowledge: Genesis 3:11\n\n> And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”\n\nMovies often make witchcraft look cool, but it only leads to destruction.\n\nThe devil is really good at taking the truth and twisting it to lead you astray.\n\n",

Many people thought Peter was just being Peter, but Jesus knows better and rebukes someone else. Check out Matthew 16:21-23:\n\n> 21 From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. 22 Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to you!” 23 Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”\n\nSatan can pretend to be humans and use them to trick others. You might think it’s your friend, teacher, or even your parent talking to you, but it could be the devil or one of his demons speaking through them.\n\nFor example, if a friend suggests you try drugs, or someone tells you you're too uptight and should loosen up, it might be the devil using them. Satan even tried to use Peter, one of Jesus' closest friends, but Jesus saw through it and spoke to Satan, not Peter. Imagine how tricky it was for people before Jesus came and revealed these deceptions.\n\n1 John 4:1-3 helps you figure out if someone is speaking by God's spirit or an evil spirit:\n\n> 4 My dear friends, do not believe all who claim to have the Spirit, but test them to find out if the spirit they have comes from God. For many false prophets have gone out everywhere. 2 This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit: anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God. 3 But anyone who denies this about Jesus does not have the Spirit from God. The spirit that he has is from the Enemy of Christ; you heard that it would come, and now it is here in the world already.\n\nImagine if the leader of your country was being tricked by Satan, which has happened before. Look at 1 Corinthians 2:8:\n\n> None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\n\nEvil spirits can fill your mind with thoughts that seem like your own, and they can make you think God is talking to you when it’s really them.\n",

Satan is the originator of this behavior. It's a craft, it is learned, and there is a spirit backing it.\n\nLet me give you an example. My friend attends prayer meetings regularly at his church. A woman joins their church and starts attending this prayer meeting under the guise that evil spirits afflict her and need deliverance and prayers. She befriends my friend who is a young man and begins to whisper in his ears that she has a prophetic gift and that most people in the church are filled with demons, evil, or something like that. So they both drop out of the prayer meeting and distance themselves from the church.\n\nAll this while my friend's father had a sore on his leg which would not heal. It was not long before my friend's mother traveled for three days. During those three days, this lady visits my friend's house and proposes a medicine to heal my friend's father's leg, which actually ends up working. My friend is sold on the woman's spiritual gifts and so is his father. She then informs my friend and his father that his mother, my friend's father's wife, is the cause of the sore that would not heal.\n\nMy friend's mother returns from her trip only to be met with hostility by both husband and son. It all makes sense to my friend now, why her mom had always been acting funny, especially when he was fasting. He now understands why he could not complete his education. He drags his mom out of the house one time and gives her a dirty slap. Mind you, this friend of mine was a firm believer and was gearing up to become a pastor or preacher. But he was never really good with his academics.\n\nMy friend's mom gets sacked from the house and goes to stay with her older daughter, the new woman moves in with her 8 children after leaving her current husband and gets impregnated by my friend.\n\nMy friend now believes that he is a junior prophet and the woman is a senior prophet, and they sometimes go out to heal people who are sick. When I am speaking with him outside his house he tells me that when he gets back to the house the woman will tell him everything that we have discussed and that even as we speak he is feeling something pressing against his skull.\n\nTo cut a long story short, my friend's father's sore returned and his leg was amputated. He later dies. My friend loses the baby he has with the woman but then elopes with her and the rest of the children to a distant community to live with her. My friend's mother regrets traveling those three days, saying, she would not have traveled if only she knew what would have happened within that short amount of time.\n",

What do you say to God when you wake up in the morning? \n14. When you finish praying should you wait for a while to hear from God, or just get up and leave? Matthew 26:36-44\n> 36 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” 37 He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee. Grief and anguish came over him, 38 and he said to them, “The sorrow in my heart is so great that it almost crushes me. Stay here and keep watch with me.”\n> \n> 39 He went a little farther on, threw himself face downward on the ground, and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, take this cup of suffering from me! Yet not what I want, but what you want.”\n> \n> 40 Then he returned to the three disciples and found them asleep; and he said to Peter, “How is it that you three were not able to keep watch with me for even one hour? 41 Keep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\n> \n> 42 Once more Jesus went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cup of suffering cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will be done.”\n> 43 He returned once more and found the disciples asleep; they could not keep their eyes open.\n> \n> 44 Again Jesus left them, went away, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.\n15.

What makes you open your mouth to speak a word?\n4. What are *motives, intents, meanings, motivating thoughts*?\n5. Does God know your *motives, intents, meanings, motivating thoughts*?\n6. Who hears you first when you utter a word, God or you?\n7. Does God need you to speak a word before he knows your *motives, intents, meanings, motivating thoughts*?\n8. If you knew what a person *meant* before they spoke, will you wait to hear what they had to say before finding out their *meaning*?\n9. Do words have value in prayer?\n10. If you know that your friend *intends* to give you a gift, do you go ahead and take the gift?\n11. If words are valueless in prayer, why does God require you to speak when you pray, anyway?\n12. If words are valueless in prayer, should you use a lot of words when you pray, in order to try to impress God? \n13. Does God answer your prayers based on your *motives, intents,  meanings, motivating thoughts*, or the words that you speak when you pray?\n14. Should you be sincere when you pray (say what you *mean*), or say one thing when you *mean* another?\n15. In what ways do humans say one thing when they *mean* another?\n16. In what ways can you be sincere in your prayers?\n17. When you plant crops close to a river and you want the river to flow to the crops, what will you have to do?\n18. Can you move the crops to the river, the river to the crops, or dig trenches from the river to the crops so that the river would flow to the crops?\n19. If God was an endless, boundless river, and your body was the land, and your mind, heart, conscience, etc. were the crops, how will you be able to let God, which is the river, flow to the crops, your will, heart, mind, conscience, desires, tongue?\n20. If God was an endless river flowing from within you, and you wanted him to fill all the members of your body(heart, mind, will, conscience, etc.) what will you have to do?\n21. How do you fill your mind with God?\n22. How do you fill your heart with God?\n23. How do you fill your conscience with God?\n24. How did Christ give his will to the Father? Luke 22:42\n> Not my will, but yours be done \n25. What kind of things will you wish for when your heart has been filled with God? \n26. How will you think when your mind has been filled with God?\n27. How will you behave the more trenches you dig in yourself for God to fill?\n28. Are you more likely to do the will of God when you are filled with God?\n29. Will you fall into temptations when the members of your body are filled with God? Matthew 26:41\n> “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\n30. Are you likely to make the right choices when the members of your body have been given to God and filled with God?\n31. When you have a difficult decision to make, do you ask God to fill you so that you can make the right choice, or do you worry?\n32. When you are faced with challenges should you ask God to take away the challenge, or fill yourself with God through prayer, so that you will be able to go through it?\n33. When things are not going your way, should you complain to God, or fill yourself with God through prayer, so that you will know the right thing to do?\n34. Is prayer for filling ourselves with God in order to do the will of God, or prayer is for instructing God, and telling God what to do?\n35. Will you always receive a word from God when you pray?\n36. When you choose God's will when you pray, is God able to naturally make you do his will and purpose for your life?\n37. Pray and choose God's will for your life each day.\n> Heavenly Father, I choose your will over mine, in the name of Jesus.\n38. Did God create Man before creating his food, or his food before creating Man?\n39. Did God wait for the Man to pray for food before providing him with his food?\n40. Has God provided all your needs?\n41. Should you use prayer to ask God for *things* (money, clothes, shoes, etc.)?\n42. Who is the first person you must talk to when you wake up in the morning?\n43. Fill yourself with God through prayer.\n",

Is God able to divide himself without losing himself?\n7. Who is the original flame?\n8. What does the Father do, personally?\n9. If the Father gives personality to all individuals, is he a personality himself, or a super personality?  \n10. Should you say that you have a certain personality because of the day that you were born? \n11. Who is the second flame to come out of the original flame?\n12. Why is the Son also called the Word? John 1:1\n>In the beginning, was the Word,  and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.\n13. Is the Word a person or a book?\n14. Has anybody seen the Father before?\n15. If you wish to know what the Father has to say, whom do you go to?\n16. How did humans know the words of the Father in Matthew 5:48?\n>Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n17. What else does the Son do apart from being the Word? John 1:1-3\n> In the beginning was the Word,  and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.  2 He was with God in the beginning.  3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. \n18. Who created our universe and everything in it including humans?\n19. In Genesis 1:3, who said let there be light, and who created the light?\n> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.\n20. Who is the third flame to come out of the original flame?\n21. What does the Spirit do, personally? John 6:63\n> It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.\n22. What makes the three Gods, Father, Son, and Spirit a Trinity?\n23. How do the three Gods, Father, Son, and Spirit agree as one?\n24. Who is God, and who is \"us?\" Genesis 1:26\n> Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky,  over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”\n25. Will you exist if all but one member of the Trinity does not agree?\n26. What does it mean to be *just*?\n27. Can the Father be *just* without the agreement of the Trinity?\n28. Is every new flame that comes out of the Father also God?\n29. Which other flames came out of the Father, who is also God but not the Father?\n30. Who are the seven Spirits of God? Isaiah 11:2\n> 1. The Spirit of Wisdom  \n> 2. The Spirit of the Lord  \n> 3. The Spirit of Understanding\n> 4. The Spirit of Counsel  \n> 5. The Spirit of Power  \n> 6. The Spirit of Knowledge\n> 7. The Spirit of the Fear of the Lord\n31. Where does the spirit of God in man come from?\n32. Does God dwell in Time, Eternity, or both?\n33. Is Eternity a long time?\n34. What is the reason for your answer?\n35. Is Eternity and Time the same thing or completely different?\n36. How do things happen in Time?\n37. How do things happen in Eternity?\n38. What is the Eternal life? John 17:3\n> 3 Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\n39. Is Eternal life God's way of life?\n40. Are you living the Eternal life when you do not know God?\n41. Are you living the Eternal life when you do not think, speak, and act like God?\n42. When do you say that a person has Eternal life?\n43. Is Eternal life a gift?\n44. How do you receive the gift of Eternal life? John 10:27-28\n> 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:\n>\n>28 And I give unto them Eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.\n45. Do you dwell in Time or Eternity?\n46. Is everything created?\n47. Is God created or uncreated?\n48. Who created existence?\n49. Does God *exist*, or God *Is*, and it is through him that other beings are brought into existence? Exodus 3:14\n> God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “You shall say this to the Israelites, 'I AM has sent me to you. ' ”\n",

In John 3:16, who is God, and who is his one and only son?\n>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\n2. Who created all things? John 1:1-3\n> In the beginning was the Word,  and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.  2 He was with God in the beginning.  3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.\n3. Did Christ exist after he was born in this world, or has he always been, and it is through him that all humans exist? John 8:48-58\n> 48 The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan  and demon-possessed?”\n> \n> 49 “I am not possessed by a demon,”  said Jesus,  “but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.  50 I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.  51 Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.”\n> \n> 52 At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death.  53 Are you greater than our father Abraham?  He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”\n> \n> 54 Jesus replied,  “If I glorify myself,  my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.  55 Though you do not know him,  I know him.  If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.  56 Your father Abraham  rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”\n> \n> 57 “You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”\n> \n> 58 “Very truly I tell you,”  Jesus answered,  “before Abraham was born,  I am!”\n4. Is Christ God?\n5. Did Christ come into the world as a man, doing God's will, or as God? John 14:10\n> 10 Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.\n6. Did Christ go through life's various stages and challenges as a man or as God?\n7. From his childhood, did Christ know that he was God? Mark 10:17-18\n> 17 As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”\n> \n> 18 “Why do you call me good?”  Jesus answered.  “No one is good—except God alone.\n8. Did Christ learn about the Father, and start his fellowship with the Father the same way as every other human would have, by going to Sunday school, studying the scriptures, and doing the will of the Father, until he and the Father had become one? Luke 2:46, Luke 2:52\n>Luke 2:46\n>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the  teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.\n>\n>Luke 2:52\n> “And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.”\n9. Who confirmed Jesus Christ as a true child of God, when his will and the Father's will had become one, after doing God's will for a long time? Matthew 3:13-17\n> 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. 14 But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”\n> \n> 15 Jesus replied,  “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.”  Then John consented.\n> \n> 16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened,  and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.  17 And a voice from heaven  said,\n> “This is my Son,  whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”\n10. Will you also receive a confirmation from the Father in your spirit when your will and the Father's will have become one after doing his will for some time? \n11. Who is the thief, what does he want, and what does Christ want for every human? John 10:10\n>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\n12. Who gave you life?\n13. If Satan can make you turn against your Father in Heaven has he stolen you from him?\n14. In what ways does Satan try to destroy the children of God?\n15. Will Satan try to kill you if all his attempts fail?\n16. In what way did Christ expect people to know who he was? John 10:24-25\n> 24 The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”\n> \n> 25 Jesus answered,  “I did tell you,  but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me,\n17. Are you *something* because of what you do every day, or what you say that you are?\n18. How is Christ the way to the Father? John 14:4-6\n> 4 You know the way to the place where I am going.” 5 Thomas  said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”\n> \n> 6 Jesus answered,  “I am the way and the truth and the life.  No one comes to  the Father except through me.\n19. What examples did Christ *do* and *teach* humans as the way to become like Christ? (Read the Gospels)\n20. Can you believe in Christ without practicing his teachings?\n21. Which examples of Christ are you following now?\n22. Was Christ willing to forgive the people who had tortured him and hanged him on the cross to die? Luke 23:34\n> 34 Jesus said, “Father,  forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.\n23. Which character and mind will be formed in you when you believe in Christ by acting on his word?\n24. How can Christ be formed in you?\n25. When you blow air into a balloon and place it on a bucket of water will it float or will it sink? \n26. When you press the balloon to the bottom of the bucket and you leave it what will happen to the balloon?\n27. How is Christ the resurrection and the life? John 11:20-26\n> 20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.\n> \n> 21 “Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died.  22 But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.”\n> \n> 23 Jesus said to her,  “Your brother will rise again.”\n> \n> 24 Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection  at the last day.”\n> \n> 25 Jesus said to her,  “I am the resurrection and the life.  The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;  26 and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.  Do you believe this?”\n28. When you do not have the character and mind of Christ can you be resurrected?\n29. In what way is a person who has become like Christ, like a balloon?\n30. Through Christ, should there be other Christs?\n31. Does Christ's resurrection teach humans that when a man has formed Christ in them, they are *capable* of being resurrected, and that resurrection is *possible*?\n32. Did Christ wish to go through the suffering on the cross, or he went through it because it was the Father's will? \n> “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”\n33. Are you also willing to do the Father's will even when it does not make you happy?\n34. Did the people of his day find it easy to accept the teachings of Christ, including the disciples?\n35. Did the disciples believe that Christ would resurrect after his death on the cross? John 20:24-29\n> 24 Now Thomas  (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.  25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”\n> \n> But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side,  I will not believe.”\n> \n> 26 A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said,  “Peace  be with you!”  27 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”\n> \n> 28 Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”\n> \n> 29 Then Jesus told him,  “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”\n36. Did Christ know that for the people to truly believe him he had to give them a sign? Matthew 12:38-39\n> 38 Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign  from you.”\n> \n> 39 He answered,  “A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.\n37. What sign would he give them to make them believe?\n38. If Christ had not died in public, would his resurrection have meant anything to the people of his day? \n39. If Christ had not resurrected from the dead, would his message have taken deeper roots in the hearts of the people, making them believe that all that he said was true? John 11:25\n> Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;\n40. When the people believed him after his resurrection were they willing to spread the message to other towns and even die while doing so?\n41. In what way did the Father use Christ's public humiliation and death on the cross to make Christ's message take deeper roots in the hearts of men after his resurrection, to the point where they were willing to die for it?\n42. Did the Father use what the Devil had planned for evil, for good, by letting Christ go through public humiliation and death, or did the Father plan to have Christ crucified all along?\n43. Can humans enter God's kingdom and be saved from darkness if only they will believe in Christ's teachings?\n44. If the price to pay for Christ's message to be accepted by the people was death by the cross, and later resurrection, was Christ willing to do what it would take by paying the price?\n45. Did the Father pay the price by giving his very best, his only begotten son?\n46. Does the Father allowing Christ to go through so much suffering teach humans how far he is willing to go to rescue even the most stubborn human from darkness?\n47. Does Christ humbling himself even unto death, teach humans how far we must be willing to go to do God's will?\n48. Can the problem of humans living in darkness, and dying because of it, be solved?\n49. Is there a price to pay to solve it?\n50. Are you willing to pay the price?\n51. Did Christ come to replace the laws of the prophets, or improve upon them and give them their full meaning? Matthew 5:33-37, Matthew 5:38-39, Matthew 19:8-11, Matthew 5:43-46, Matthew 5:27-28, Matthew 5:17\n>Matthew 5:33-37\n>33 “Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.’ 34 But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne; 35 or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 36 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. 37 All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.\n>\n>Matthew 5:38-39 \n>38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ 39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.\n>\n>Matthew 19:8-11\n>8 Jesus replied,  “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.  9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”\n>\n>Matthew 5:43-46\n>43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?\n>\n>Matthew 5:27-28\n>27 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\n>\n>Matthew 5:17\n>Don't suppose I came to do away with the Law and the Prophets.

I will send my son, whom I love;  perhaps they will respect him.’\n> \n> 14 “But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’  15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\n> \n> “What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?  16 He will come and kill those tenants  and give the vineyard to others.”\n> \n> When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!”\n> \n> 17 Jesus looked directly at them and asked,  “Then what is the meaning of that which is written:\n> \n> “‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?\n> \n> 18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”\n> \n> 19 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them.

You brood of vipers!  How will you escape being condemned to hell?  34 Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify;  others you will flog in your synagogues  and pursue from town to town.  35 And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel  to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah,  whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.\n73.

They made her stand before the group 4 and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” 6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.\n> \n> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the\n> ground.\n> \n> 9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they?

For no one could perform the signs  you are doing if God were not with him.”\n> \n> 3 Jesus replied,  “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.”\n> \n> 4 “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be\n> born!”\n> \n> 5 Jesus answered,  “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.  6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.  7 You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’  8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”\n> \n> 9 “How can this be?”  Nicodemus asked.\n> \n> 10 “You are Israel’s teacher,”  said Jesus,  “and do you not understand these things?  11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know,  and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.  12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?\n88.

Did Christ rule over our universe after creating it, or did he wait until he had first put on human nature, thereby becoming both Son of God and Son of Man? Matthew 28:16-18\n> 16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.  17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.  18 Then Jesus came to them and said,  “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\n92.

Did Christ live his life on earth by seeking the will of the Father and doing it? John 6:38\n> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.\n100. Should humans also spend their lives seeking the will of God and doing it?\n101. Was Christ able to fulfill the law? Matthew 5:17\n>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\n102. Is Christ able to help you fulfill the law as well?\n",

John 14:16-17\n> 16 I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, who will stay with you forever. 17 He is the Spirit, who reveals the truth about God. The world cannot receive him, because it cannot see him or know him. But you know him, because he remains with you and is in you.\n2. Which kind of people cannot receive the Holy Spirit?\n3. Why can't the people of the world receive the Holy Spirit?\n4. Will the Holy Spirit ever leave you after you have received him?\n5. In what ways will the Holy Spirit help you? John 16:13, John 14:26, John 16:13, Acts 1:8\n> John 16:13\n> But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.\n>\n>John 14:26\n>26 The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and make you remember all that I have told you.\n>\n>John 16:13\n>13 When, however, the Spirit comes, who reveals the truth about God, he will lead you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of what he hears and will tell you of things to come.\n>\n>Acts 1:8\n>8 But when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will be filled with power, and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, in all of Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”\n6.  Is the Holy Spirit a person, a thing, or a dove?\n7. If Christ did not ascend into Heaven, would the Holy Spirit be sent to earth? John 16:7\n> 7 But I am telling you the truth: it is better for you that I go away, because if I do not go, the Helper will not come to you. But if I do go away, then I will send him to you.\n8. Can you live the life of Christ without the Holy Spirit?\n9. Will God give you the Holy Spirit if you ask? Luke 11:9-13\n> 9 “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you;  seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.  10 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.\n>11 “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?  12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?  13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”\n10. Do you wish to receive the Holy Spirit?\n11. What happened to the disciples on the day of Pentecost?  Acts 2:1-4\n> 2 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.  2 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.  3 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.  4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.\n12. Has the Holy Spirit been sent down on earth?\n13. When was the Holy Spirit sent down on earth?\n14. When the disciples received the Holy Spirit what was the first thing they did? \n15. When you receive the Holy Spirit will there be a visible sign?\n16. When you receive the Holy Spirit will you also be able to speak in other tongues?\n17. Does speaking in tongues align your will with the will of God?\n18. Pray and thank God for the gift of the Holy Spirit. \n19. Since the Holy Spirit has already been sent down, you only have to ask the Holy Spirit to come and fill you in Jesus' name. After praying, open your mouth and speak whatever language the Spirit enables you to speak.\n20. In what way does John the Baptist baptize? Matthew 3:11\n> 11 I baptize you with water to show that you have repented, but the one who will come after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. He is much greater than I am; and I am not good enough even to carry his sandals.\n21. In what way does Jesus Christ baptize?\n22. Which baptism is greater?\n23. Speak in tongues as often as you can and follow the leadings of the Spirit\n",

What are some uses of wheat?\n5. Have you seen a weed before?\n6. Pull out a weed from around you and show it to your instructor.\n7. Can you cook a weed and eat it?\n8. When a weed grows around a tomato plant, will the tomato grow properly and be colorful?\n9. What is the reason for your answer?\n10. What do we do with weeds?\n11. When a weed grows around a plant that you intend to eat, what do you do with it?\n12. What is the parable of the Wheat and the Weeds? Matthew 13:24-30\n> 24 Jesus told them another parable:  “The kingdom of heaven is like  a man who sowed good seed in his field.  25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.  26 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.\n>\n>27 “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’\n>\n>28 “‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.\n>\n>“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’\n>\n>29 “‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.  30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”\n13. If you plant a good seed, can it grow into a bad tree?\n14. Can a tomato grow into a banana tree?\n15. From the parable, how did the man know that an enemy had planted weeds in his field?\n16. In verse 29, why did the man not want the servants to remove the weeds?\n17. Do the weeds and the wheat look very much alike?\n18. Why will the servants accidentally pull out the wheat?\n19. From this parable, who is the man who planted the good seeds?\n20. What are the good seeds?\n21. Who are the servants?\n22. Who is the enemy who planted the weeds?\n23. What are the weeds?\n24. What does the field represent?\n25. In verse 30, what will happen to the weeds?\n26. How does Christ explain the parable of the wheat and the weeds? Matthew 13:37-43\n> 37 He answered,  “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.  38 The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,  39 and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest  is the end of the age,  and the harvesters are angels.\n>\n>40 “As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.  41 The Son of Man  will send out his angels,  and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.  42 They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun  in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\n27. Is a human being a seed?\n28. What is the reason for your answer?\n29. From the explanation above, who is the man who planted the good seeds?\n30. What are the good seeds?\n31. Who are the servants?\n32. Who is the enemy who planted the weeds?\n33. What are the weeds?\n34. What does the field represent?\n35. Are all humans put here by Christ?\n36. Who are the two kinds of humans in this world?\n37. Do the children of the Devil and the children of God look alike at the beginning when they are born?\n38. What are some things that the child of the Devil will do to expose who they are?\n39. Did all the teachings of Christ stop Judas Iscariot from betraying him?\n40. Can the seeds of the enemy receive the Holy Spirit? John 14:16-17\n> 16 I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, who will stay with you forever. 17 He is the Spirit, who reveals the truth about God. The world cannot receive him, because it cannot see him or know him. But you know him, because he remains with you and is in you.\n41. What are the fruits of the seeds of God, when they are fed with the word of God?\n42. In the end, what will happen to every human who was not put here by Christ?\n43. What will the children of the Devil attempt to do to the seeds that were put here by Christ?\n44. Is life on earth going to be easy for the children of God, as long as the children of the Devil remain on earth?\n45. Does being a child of God mean that you automatically accept God as your father?\n46. Pray to God, accept him as your father, and ask him to take you as his child and make you what he wishes to make of you.\n47. What does a sword do? Matthew 10:34\n>34 “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\n",

Matthew 13:31-32\n> 31 Jesus told them another parable: “The Kingdom of heaven is like this. A man takes a mustard seed and sows it in his field. 32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows up, it is the biggest of all plants. It becomes a tree, so that birds come and make their nests in its branches.”\n3. What is the meaning of the parable? \n4. When the word of God is taught to the child of the kingdom who appears little or insignificant, and they practice it, are they able to grow up to become mighty like the mustard seed, and do far better than the seeds of the enemy who may appear bigger and more intelligent in the beginning? \n5. Can the children of the devil be so transformed by the word of God that they grow to become mighty like the mustard seed?\n6. When teaching the word of God, should you look down on those who are little, can barely speak up, and struggle to understand what you are teaching?\n7. What is the meaning of Matthew 13:33?\n> 33 Jesus told them still another parable: “The Kingdom of heaven is like this. A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour until the whole batch of dough rises.”\n8. What is the flour?\n9. What does the yeast represent?\n10. If you wish to grow as a child of God, what do you have to do?\n11. How long have these things been kept secret from mankind? Matthew 13:34-35\n> 34 Jesus used parables to tell all these things to the crowds; he would not say a thing to them without using a parable. 35 He did this to make come true what the prophet had said,\n“I will use parables when I speak to them;  \nI will tell them things unknown since the creation of the world.”\n12. What is the parable of the fishing net? Matthew 13:47-50\n> 47 “Also, the Kingdom of heaven is like this. Some fishermen throw their net out in the lake and catch all kinds of fish. 48 When the net is full, they pull it to shore and sit down to divide the fish: the good ones go into the buckets, the worthless ones are thrown away. 49 It will be like this at the end of the age: the angels will go out and gather up the evil people from among the good 50 and will throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will cry and gnash their teeth.\n13. What is the meaning of the parable?\n14. Is Christ looking for all humans or only those who belong in the kingdom?\n15. When you are teaching the word of God, should you be in a hurry to separate the good seeds from the bad seeds, or first gather all the people that you can, teach them, treat them equally, and let them eventually set themselves apart?\n16. What does it mean to despise a little child who belongs in the kingdom? Matthew 18:10\n> 10 “See that you don't despise any of these little ones. Their angels in heaven, I tell you, are always in the presence of my Father in heaven.\n17. Should you treat a little child as if they were nothing because they are little?\n18. What do their angels do before the Father in his presence?\n19. Are their angels able to carry out instructions from the Father on their behalf?\n20. What is the parable of the lost sheep? Matthew 18:12-14\n> 12 “What do you think a man does who has one hundred sheep and one of them gets lost? He will leave the other ninety-nine grazing on the hillside and go and look for the lost sheep. 13 When he finds it, I tell you, he feels far happier over this one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost. 14 In just the same way your Father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to be lost.\n21. Does the shepherd go looking for a sheep that did not originally belong to them?\n22. Did the children of God belong to the Father from the beginning?\n23. Does the Father treat his children as numbers, or as only begotten?\n24. What does it mean to be an only-begotten child, when you have many siblings?\n25. When the Father loses you to the lies and deceit of the Devil, will he continue to be happy because he has many other children, or he will be sad and do whatever he can to get you back?\n26. Does the Father love each of his children as if they were his only child?\n\n\n",

Read Isaiah 6:1-4\n> 6 In the year that  King Uzziah died I  saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.  2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.  3 And one called to another and said:\n> \n> “Holy, holy, holy is the  Lord  of hosts;   the whole earth is full of his glory!”\n> \n> 4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.  \n3. If you were prophet Isaiah and you saw this vision of God sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, what would this tell you about God?\n4. Is God a king?\n5. Is God Holy?\n6. If God is a king then how should we conduct ourselves before him?\n7. Where did the train of God's robe or garment fill?\n8. Does God live in temples?\n9. Is your body God's temple?\n10. What is the reason for your answer?\n11. How should you treat your body if it is a temple of God?\n12. Should you think carelessly?\n13. Should you speak anyhow?\n14. Should you dress anyhow, or dress majestically like God?\n15. Should you be profane?\n16. In verse 5, why did prophet Isaiah feel the way he did?\n> 5 And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”\n17. In verse 6, why did the seraphim touch prophet Isaiah's mouth with the burning coal?\n> 6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.  7 And he  touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”\n18. Was God the one who told the prophet Isaiah that he was unclean?\n19. How did the prophet Isaiah know that he was unclean?\n20. What happened to his guilt after his sins were atoned for?\n21. When we wish to speak with God, should we go straight to the point or should we start with thanksgiving, praises, and adoration?\n22. Give thanks for 10 things that God has done for you. \n23. Give God praises and adoration.\n",

Who first had life, and chose to share that life with his children?\n4. In what way does God share himself with his children?\n5. Who planted the Garden of Eden?\n6. Is God a gardener and someone who loves nature and beautiful flowers and loves to care for them?\n7. Is God gentle, sensitive, and also, thoughtful? Genesis 2:21\n> 21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;\n8. Did God create Adam before creating his food, or his food before creating Adam?\n9. Is God orderly and does he follow a process to get things done?\n10. Does God like to do excellent things and pay attention to details? Exodus 31:1-5\n> Then the  Lord said to Moses,  2 “See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur,  of the tribe of Judah,  3 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—  4 to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,  5 to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts.\n11. Is God majestic and also a King? \n12. Will the worshipper of God Most High, also become majestic like a king, gentle, caring, sensitive, orderly, thoughtful, sharing, etc?\n13. Does God want you to worship him because someone asked you to, or because you understand why you worship?\n14. What is intelligent worship?\n15. Should you ask God for *things* when you worship?\n16. Is every worshipper, a true worshipper? John 4:21-23\n> 21 “Woman,”  Jesus replied,  “believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.  22 You Samaritans worship what you do not know;  we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.  23 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.\n17. What is true worship?\n18. What kind of energy do you receive from God when you worship him with spiritual songs?\n19. Does spiritual energy help you to go through difficulties in life?\n20. Does spiritual energy make you sensitive to the spirit?\n21. Do you know that your body is a temple and God lives in you?\n22. What should you do if you wish to feel the presence of God in you?\n23. Does God expect you to worship more than you pray, or pray more than you worship?\n24. What is the reason for your answer?\n25. Name a song you can use to worship God each morning when you wake up before you start your day.\n26. Close your eyes and picture God sitting on his throne, high and lifted up, worship God with the song [We Give You Glory Lord As We Honour You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7gvxW42K7w&pp=ygUZa2FobGVobyB5b3UgYXJlIHdvbmRlcmZ1bA%3D%3D \"KALEHO - We Give You Glory Lord As We Honour You (You are Wonderful) ft.

Each morning you wake up earlier than you usually do, and do a few things:\n\t-  You say a prayer\n\t- Sing a worship song to God. Singing worship songs has a way of transforming you from the inside, making you spiritually sensitive, and also allowing you to feel the presence of God in you.\n\t-  Read a portion of scripture. You can start with the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) before saying Proverbs, Psalms, and the others.\n\t-  Meditate on what you have read and think about ways in which you can apply it. For instance, if Christ said that we shall be judged by every single word that we speak, I will start by repenting from every foul word I have ever spoken and be determined to speak only good words from now on.\n\t- God will begin to speak with you. Do as he says.\n\n",

Read the following and use it to answer the subsequent questions:\n> Imagine you have a really good friend who always helps you with stuff that would be really hard to do by yourself. One day, this friend does something that makes you really mad. You keep thinking about what you'll say or do when you see them again. Now you have two choices: you can either keep the friendship you had or stay angry at them. \n2. What will happen if you choose friendship?\n3. Will you be able to continue working with them?\n4. Will you have to avoid them, anytime you meet them?\n5. What will happen if you choose your anger?\n6. Will you be able to continue your friendship with them?\n7. Will you have to avoid them, anytime you meet them?\n8. What look would you have to wear on your face if you had to be in the same place with them?\n9. Will you choose friendship or your anger?\n10. If you chose friendship, what do you have to do in response to the offense?\n11. Should your friend know that they have been forgiven?\n12. What will happen if you forgave them, but did not let them know that they had been forgiven?\n13. How will you let your friend know that you have forgiven them?\n14. Will your friends, parents, or even siblings one day offend you?\n15. Why will they offend you no matter what?\n16. Will you forgive them now, or you will wait until after they have offended you first and said apologized?\n17. Do you **fore**give be**fore** or after you have been offended?\n18. After offending someone, what do you carry on your conscience?\n19. What happens when you sprinkle water over hot oil on a fire?\n20. What causes the guilt in your conscience after you have offended someone?\n21. When you feel guilty, can you carry out your duties like before?\n22. When you are forgiven, what happens to your guilt? Isaiah 6:1-7\n> In the year that  King Uzziah died I  saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.  2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.  3 And one called to another and said:\n> \n> “Holy, holy, holy is the  Lord  of hosts;   the whole earth is full of his glory!”\n> \n> 4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.  5 And I said: “Woe is me!  For I am lost;  for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the  Lord  of hosts!”\n> \n> 6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.  7 And he  touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”\n23. If you were about to start an adventure and someone told you that making even one mistake would be deadly, and you knew you weren't perfect and were bound to mess up, would you still go on the adventure?\n24. Can you become perfect at something without a second or multiple attempts?\n25. If you do not forgive the people who offend you, will they get another chance to do better? \n26. How does forgiving others help them to become perfect? \n27. When a person insults you for no reason at all, do you just stay silent and not mind them, or do you show them an act of love by saying \"Thank you!\" with a smile?\n28. Who forgives best, the one who does nothing when they are offended, or the one who responds with kindness?\n29. What did Jesus mean by turning the other cheek? Matthew 5:39\n>39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.\n30. Is forgiveness needed in Heaven?\n31. What is the reason for your answer\n32. Is there someone that you have not forgiven?\n33. If yes, then what are you waiting for?\n",

Is a friendship serving its purpose when friends do not encourage each other when they feel like giving up?\n12. When correcting someone, which is the strongest voice, loudest, or lowest?\n13. Point out something that you do not like about your friend and correct them.\n14. Can you make friends when you are not friendly yourself?\n15. Is God able to work in connection with his ministering angels and spiritual agencies to connect two individuals who must join together in a friendship?\n16. Who do angels take their instructions from? Psalm 91:11-12\n> For he will command his angels  concerning you  \nto guard you in all your ways;  \n>12 they will lift you up in their hands,  \nso that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\n17. How do we show God that we appreciate the friends that he has given us?\n18. Practice this with your friends: \n\t- When going out with your friends, only do what you *all* agree on\n\t- Avoid doing anything that at least one of you disagrees with\n",

When a tree starts to grow and become bent, how do you make it grow straight?\n5. Can the stick make the tree straight when it is itself bent?\n6. When the tree is already grown, and it is bent, can you make it straight?\n7. When is the best time to make a tree straight?\n8. When a little tree has been made straight, will it ever get bent again?\n9. Do you know that you are a little bent tree?\n10. When you still insult other people, are you straight?\n11. When you still disobey your teachers, are you straight?\n12. When you hide things from your parents, are you straight?\n13. What can go wrong when you hide things from your parents?\n14. In this story, why did I lose my leg?\n> My mom warned me not to climb trees when I went to school. She said that if she found out I had climbed a tree, I would be punished. But as soon as I got to school, I climbed a tree anyway. The branch broke, and I fell, breaking my leg. I didn't tell my teachers or my parents about the injury and tried to hide it.\n>\n>After a week, my parents noticed a terrible smell in the house, like something rotting. They searched for the source of the smell and eventually discovered it was my leg, which had started to fester. They rushed me to the hospital. The doctor said if they had brought me in right after the accident, my leg could have healed. But now, they had to either cut off my leg or risk the infection spreading to the rest of my body. I decided to have my leg amputated, and the doctor performed the surgery.\n15. What would be the most likely outcome of this story and what will happen to my parent's trust?\n> My friend gave me a phone and asked me to hide it at my house. She told me not to tell anyone, so I didn't. A short time later, the police came knocking at my door, asking about a stolen phone. My parents, trusting that I wouldn't do anything like that, kept insisting that I hadn't hidden any phone in the house.

The  Lord answered his prayer, and Rebecca became pregnant. 22 She was going to have twins, and before they were born, they struggled against each other in her womb. She said, “Why should something like this happen to me?” So she went to ask the  Lord for an answer.\n> \n> 23 The  Lord  said to her,\n>\n>“Two nations are within you;  \nYou will give birth to two rival peoples.  \nOne will be stronger than the other;  \nThe older will serve the younger.”\n24. Draw the flag of your nation.\n25. Would anybody like to visit your nation?\n26. Activity: Demonstrate how the nations of the world came to practice greetings.\n\n",

Is the parent of the child the one who gives birth to the child or the person who treats the child like their own child?\n5. If the child looks up to you as a parent, and is willing to do all that you instruct them to, are you the parent of the child or the one who gave birth to them?\n6. What are your responsibilities towards the child as their parent?\n7. Should you meet the child's physical needs only, or spiritual as well?\n8. How do you meet the child's physical needs?\n9. How do you meet the child's spiritual needs?\n10. If the child's physical needs are not taken care of, like food, clothing, and shelter can you develop the mind of the child?\n11. If the child is *always* occupied with physical work, can the child have time to do the things that will help them to develop?\n12. How do you protect the child?\n13. Should you protect the body of the child only, or their minds as well?\n14. In what ways can you protect the mind of a child?\n15. Does the child have a mind of their own or do they simply mirror what they see other people do?\n16. How do you help the child to form their mind?\n17. How can you help the child form their mind about strangers, and how to treat them?\n18. How can you help the child form their mind about the purpose of their lives and how to live it?\n19. How can you help the child form their mind about dressing up?\n20. How can you help the child form their mind about God and who God is to them?\n21. When you get tired of talking to the child and answering their questions are you helping them to form their mind?\n22. If you do not help the child to form their mind, will they form their mind elsewhere?\n23. In what ways can the child form their mind elsewhere?\n24. If you are always thinking for the child and making decisions for them, will their mind form properly?\n25. Does the child have a will of their own or they are born having their own will?\n26. In what ways can you help shape the will of a child?\n27. Can you shape the will of a child when you do not allow them to make choices and face the consequences of their choices?\n28. If you are always forcing them to do the right thing are you shaping the will of the child?\n29. Does the child have a character of their own?\n30. How can you help the child form their character?\n31. Between which ages is the child easily influenced?\n32. Whom should the child spend the most easily influenced period of their life with?\n33. Should the child spend this period of their life with a stranger, or with their parents?\n34. What does it mean to socialize a person?\n35. In what ways can a child be socialized by their parent, the more they spend time with them?\n36. Can a parent socialize their child when they are too busy to spend time with them?\n37. Can a parent socialize their child successfully if they lose their child's respect?\n38. Can a parent speak, dress, or act anyhow and still keep their child's respect?\n39. What are some things a parent should not do if they wish to be respected by their child?\n40. What are some things a parent should do if they wish to be respected by their child?\n41. In what ways can you socialize a child's religion?\n42. In what ways can you socialize a child's language?\n43. In what ways can you socialize a child's attitude?\n44. In what ways can you socialize a child's traditions?\n45. Should you complete the child's socialization before handing them over to the society whose socialization may not always be in agreement with yours?\n46. What is formed between the parent and the child the more they spend time together?\n47. What is the importance of the bond that is formed between a parent and a child?\n48. Can the parent instruct the child and they will obey even when they are much older than the age that they are easily influenced, because of the bond that they share together?\n49. Can the child decide one day that their parent is no longer their parent, and begin to treat them like a stranger when they share a bond?\n50. Does this bond help the child to follow the right path and not do anything that will disappoint their parents?\n51. Is it better for the child to form this bond with a stranger or another person who they do not live with, or with their parents who they live with?\n52. What could go wrong if the child forms a bond with a stranger whom they do not live with, rather than their parents who they spend most of their time with?\n53. Who is the most influential person in the life of the child?\n54. Who is responsible for how a child will turn out in life?\n55. Who is your first Pastor?\n56. Who is your first Teacher?\n57.

My daughter has a demon and is in a terrible condition.”\n> \n> 23 But Jesus did not say a word to her. His disciples came to him and begged him, “Send her away!

Guess what, he lives in you and hears everything you say. You confess your sins to him and ask for forgiveness. You then surrender yourself to him. Yes, the Christian life begins with acknowledging that God knows what is best for you and totally surrendering your heart, mind, body, and soul to him. Tell him \"Heavenly Father, I give you my heart, I give you my mind, I give you my body and soul in Jesus' name.\" God uses your heart to guide you. Each day that you wake up you must consecrate yourself unto God by surrendering yourself to him. As you continue to follow the leading of his spirit he will begin his work of perfecting you.\n\nYou can later find a church to fellowship with. \n\nYour quiet time with God is also very important in your walk with God. Each morning you wake up earlier than you usually do, and do a few things:\n\n-  You say a prayer\n- Sing a worship song. Singing worship songs has a way of transforming you from the inside, making you spiritually sensitive, and also allowing you to feel the presence of God in you.\n-  You say a prayer\n-  Read a portion of scripture. I recommend that you start with the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) before saying Proverbs, Psalms, and the others.\n-  Meditate on what you have read and think about ways in which you can apply it. For instance, if Christ said that we shall be judged by every single word that we speak, I will start by repenting from every foul word I have ever spoken and be determined to speak only good words from now on.\n- God will begin to speak to you. Do as he says.\n\nGod is not concerned with where you are now or where you have been; only where you wish to be. He knows how to get you to your destination, so don't let your past sins weigh you down.\n\nMatthew 5: 48\n\n",

If one tribe felt wronged by another, they would gather their warriors, attack, and completely destroy the other tribe. Entire groups of people were wiped out this way. When they were angry, they showed no mercy. Nobody told them that even if you’ve been wronged, you should hold back when punishing others. No one suggested taking some prisoners or stopping when the other side gave up and begged for forgiveness.\n\nThen one day, a preacher came along, talking about mercy. He said that God is merciful, and people should be merciful too. Even if you’re angry, it doesn’t mean you should destroy a whole village.\n\nI once saw something really upsetting while teaching kids about God in a community. There were two kids fighting, and one of them just kept swinging and hitting, not even looking at the other kid. She didn’t care if her opponent was hurt, bleeding, or in serious danger.\n\nTaking prisoners was actually a step forward in human civilization. Nations that didn't practice this were considered uncivilized.\n",
