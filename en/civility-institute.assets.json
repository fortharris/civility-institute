Does the spirit of the Father come to live in you?\n9. Do you start taking steps with God?\n10. Why is every step that you take with God called a spirit victory? \n11. When you take steps with God until you become one with God, do you and the Father have the same will?\n12. Do you like the things that the Father likes?\n13. Do you dislike the things that the Father also dislikes?\n14. Do you and God think, speak, and act alike?\n15. What did Christ say about himself and the Father when he reached this stage?\n16. Are you now under *grace*?\n17. Will you willfully disobey the Father?\n18. Do you receive anything that you ask the Father?\n19. Why do you receive anything that you ask the Father?\n20. When you learn from your teacher, do you set questions for yourself, answer the questions, and then tell yourself that you have passed?\n21. How would you know that you and the Father have now become one?\n22. Will you have any doubts that you are truly a child of the Father when the Father confirms you himself?\n23. Do you want the Father to confirm you, or do you want other humans to confirm you?\n24. When your spirit is mature, are you able to ascend into the Heavens without first sleeping?\n25. When your spirit is mature, are you able to grow to old age because God needs you around to put the good in you into others, you sleep, and then you ascend into the Heavens\n26. Which individuals were translated into Heaven without first sleeping?\n27. What happens to the spirit of the Father in you, when you fail to ascend?\n28. If a reason must be given on behalf of each individual who fails to ascend, why they failed to ascend, should we do what we can to help each other to grow, or rather, discourage them?\n29.

                    "markdown": "# I Am a Little Seed II\n\n1. In **Mathew 5:48**, who is speaking?\n> 48 You must be perfect\u2014just as your Father in heaven is perfect.\n2. Who is God speaking to?\n3. What does God expect from every man?\n4. Is it possible to become perfect?\n5. Is it possible to become like God?\n6. What does it mean to be perfect?\n7. Are you perfect when you are not respectful?\n8. Are you perfect when you are not kind?\n9. If you wish to become like someone, what do you have to do?\n10. How does a man become perfect like God?\n11. Read **Psalm 82** twice\n> 1 God presides in the great assembly;  \nhe renders judgment  among the \u201cgods\u201d:\n>\n> 2 \u201cHow long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked? \n> 3 Defend the weak and the fatherless;  uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.   \n> 4 Rescue the weak and the needy;   deliver them from the hand of the wicked.\n> \n> 5 \u201cThe \u2018gods\u2019 know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness;   all the foundations of the earth are shaken.\n> \n> 6 \u201cI said, \u2018You are \u201cgods\u201d;   you are all sons of the Most High.\u2019   \n> 7 But you will die  like mere mortals;   you will fall like every other ruler.\u201d\n> \n> 8 Rise up,  O God, judge the earth,   for all the nations are your inheritance.\n12. What is judgment?\n13. Which people have gathered?\n14. Who is leading the gathering?\n15. In verse 2, what are the gods doing wrong?\n16. What does God expect from the gods in verse 3?\n17. What does God expect from the gods in verse 4?\n18. Who is the Most High in verse 6?\n19. Why does God have to remind the gods that \"I said, \u2018You are \u201cgods\u201d; you are all sons of the Most High?\"\n20. Read  **John 10:30-36**\n> 30 I and the Father are one.\u201d\n> \n> 31 Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him,  32 but Jesus said to them,  \u201cI have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?\u201d\n> \n> 33 \u201cWe are not stoning you for any good work,\u201d they replied, \u201cbut for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.\u201d\n> \n> 34 Jesus answered them,  \u201cIs it not written in your Law,  \u2018I have said you are \u201cgods\u201d\u2019?  35 If he called them \u2018gods,\u2019 to whom the word of God came\u2014and Scripture cannot be set aside\u2014  36 what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world?  Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, \u2018I am God\u2019s Son\u2019?\n21. In verse 33, why did the Jews try to stone Jesus?\n22. What is blasphemy?\n23. In verse 34, which part of the bible was Jesus referring to?\n24. In verse 35, who are the gods?\n25. Read  Psalm 82 again\n26. In verse 5, Why does God say that \"The \u2018gods\u2019 know nothing, they understand nothing...?\"\n27. Do the gods know that they are gods?\n28. Do the gods know that they are all sons of the Most High, and can become like God?\n29. What happens to you when you walk in a place without light?\n30. When do we say that a person is living in darkness?\n31. In verse 5, why does God say that the gods walk about in darkness?\n32. Is the earth a school?\n33. What is the purpose of a school?\n34. What are the gods supposed to learn before they leave the earth?\n35. When a person walks into a school and comes out worse than they entered it, is the school serving its purpose?\n36. When all the people who walk into a school, come out worse than they entered it, and bad has now become good, is the school serving its purpose?\n37. Why does God say that the earth has gone out of course?\n38. Even though men are children of the Most High, what will happen to them if they do not conduct themselves like sons of God?\n39. Did the Jews understand Psalm 82 at the time of Jesus?\n40. Do the people around you know and understand Psalm 82?\n41. What are you going to do about it?\n42. Read **Numbers 18:20**\n>  20 The Lord said to Aaron, \u201cYou will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites.\n43. *The children of Israel had settled down and divided the lands among themselves. Aaron asks God what his share will be and God tells him that He, God, will be his share and inheritance.*\n44. How does God become your share and your portion?\n45. When you become like God, can you also do the things that God can do?\n46. Do you want God or the things that God has created?\n47. How do you inherit someone?\n48. How do you inherit God, who will not die?\n49. Who received the greatest gift among the children of Israel?\n \n\n\n",

                    "markdown": "# Christ in a Nutshell\n\nTo really get who Christ is, you need to understand the Trinity. John explains it best in John 1.\n\nIn the Old Testament, people only knew about God, but it turns out there are multiple spirit personalities that are also God. Christ is one of them, and He\u2019s actually the creator of the world and everything in it.\n\nGod doesn't exist; He is, and He brings everything into existence. Christ has always existed, even before He came to earth. This confused a lot of people who thought they knew all about His birth and family. John 8:48-59.\n\nChrist didn\u2019t want people to recognize Him just by His words but wanted them to figure it out through His actions and understanding of the scriptures.\n\nChrist had the power to forgive sins and had been doing so long before His crucifixion. Luke 5:24.\n\nThe whole idea of atonement tries to make sense of His brutal death on the cross. Even so, He told the Jews not to weep for Him as He was about to be crucified because He knew that what would happen to them after His death and resurrection would be worse than dying on the cross. Luke 23:27-28.\n\nBefore His death, Christ said many things that were hard for people to accept. John 11:20-26. He didn\u2019t just have the power to bring people back to life; He is the resurrection. This means that if you become like Christ by following Him through the Holy Spirit, you\u2019ll be like a balloon that won\u2019t sink in water. Even if you get pushed down, you\u2019ll rise again. You\u2019ll never really die; if you\u2019re killed, you\u2019ll come back to life.\n\nMany people thought Christ was possessed, called Him a Samaritan, a madman, and didn\u2019t take Him seriously. He knew that for people to believe, He had to show them a sign. Matthew 12:38-42.\n\nWhen it was time for Him to be crucified, His enemies, including the devil, thought they could humiliate Him. But they didn\u2019t know that the Father planned to use this to glorify the Son and spread His message. Stay with me here.\n\nIf Christ hadn\u2019t died publicly, His resurrection wouldn\u2019t have meant much to anyone. His public humiliation, death on the cross, burial, and resurrection on the third day made it clear to everyone that Christ, the carpenter\u2019s son, was telling the truth. This shook the devil and convinced people who were unsure about His teachings. This is what made Christ's message spread and take root in people\u2019s hearts to the point where they were willing to die for it. Even His disciples didn\u2019t believe it at first and needed proof, like seeing the marks on His palms.\n\nChrist is the key to the Father\u2019s house. He is the way, the truth, and the life. Become like Christ, and you will live. Through Him, more people can become like Christ, and then they can ascend. The Holy Spirit is here to help with that. You can\u2019t live a Christian life without the Holy Spirit. To be like Christ is to have Christ. I can\u2019t stress this enough. Believing in the Son of God means acting on His every word, not just saying you believe. That\u2019s how you become.\n\nThe path is narrow because many people try to find their own way into God\u2019s kingdom without changing themselves.\n\nMatthew 5:48. The only way to become like God is to imitate Him. There\u2019s no other way. Christ is our role model and standard. After taking on human nature, He can now help humans overcome their limitations and reach the Father\u2019s mark of perfection.\n",

What do I still lack?\u201d\n>\n> 21 Jesus said to him, \u201cIf you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.\u201d\n>\n> 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.\n\nThe rich young ruler must follow three steps:\n- Follow all the commandments\n- Give all that he has to the poor\n- Follow Christ (for it is by following and imitating God that a man becomes like God)\n\n\n",

You go to her house to talk to the mother with the hope that her mother might stop beating her. Her mother rather gets angry and starts beating her even more. Did you commit sin or evil?\n28. What might be a possible cure to prevent you from making the same mistake again?\n29. A man wants to build a house. He first has to clear the land so he cuts down a few trees that are growing on the land. After building the house he falls sick and prays to God. God tells him that the medicine that will cure his sickness can only be found in the tree that he had cut whiles building his house. Did the man commit sin or evil?\n30. What can be done to cure him so he does not make the same mistake again?\n31. Give other examples of evil, sin, and iniquity, and how they can be cured\n\n",

For many false prophets have gone out everywhere. 2 This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit: anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God. 3 But anyone who denies this about Jesus does not have the Spirit from God. The spirit that he has is from the Enemy of Christ; you heard that it would come, and now it is here in the world already.\n58. Pray and ask God to give you the spirit of discernment to be able to tell the difference between spirits.\n",

They attach themselves to the individual, bind them and nothing they do can set them free. They are stuck in a cycle of defeat. You will hate what you do each time you do it because there is a pure spirit in you reacting to the bad that you have introduced into your system, but after repenting, you will return to doing it again. Christ calls this demon the strongman.\n\nMark 3:27\n\n> In fact, no one can enter a strong man\u2019s house without first tying him up. Then  he can plunder the strong man\u2019s house.\n\nFortunately, Christ has given the believer authority over the powers of darkness (yes, they do have power).\n\nLuke 10:19 \n> I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.\n\nMark 16:17-18\n\n> 17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;\n> \n> 18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\n\nThe believer, not God, shall cast out devils. Force the demon out in the name of Jesus. Mark 16:17, Mark 5:8, Mark 9:25. Command the spirit of pornography, [insert sin] to leave you in the name of Jesus and never return.\n\nAfter this give your heart, mind, and body to God. Tell God \"Heavenly Father, I give you my heart, I give you my mind, I give you my body and soul in the name of Jesus.\" Let this be your daily consecration.\n\n",

First, they create a distraction because as long as you're paying attention, they can't take anything. They might notice where you keep your money. If it's in your left pocket, they might tap you on your right shoulder and then sneak their hand into your left pocket to steal your money without you noticing.\n\nThink about a hen. She's usually calm and harmless, but if you try to take one of her chicks or get too close, she'll defend them fiercely. So, if you wanted to steal one of her chicks without a fight, you'd need a distraction.\n\nWhen you're focused on a goal, sometimes you don't notice other important things slipping away. It's like a trick to keep you distracted from what truly matters.\n\nIn the past, a husband and wife would agree on who does what at home. The husband would go to work and earn money, while the wife took care of the house and kids. This way, the kids were always looked after, and any bad behavior was quickly noticed and corrected. The parents could guide their kids' upbringing.\n\nBut then, the wife might hear a little voice saying, \"You're being cheated! You can make as much money as your husband. You're wasting your life at home while he gets to have a career. What if something happens to him? How will you take care of the kids?\"\n\nSo, the wife gets a job and hands over her responsibilities to someone else. While she's busy working, guess who's left vulnerable? The kids, and the one who comes to take advantage of this is the devil.\n\nWhen couples start fighting, it's often because the devil is trying to distract them so he can influence their kids. He's not interested in the husband or wife; his target is the children.\n\nIf a husband suddenly finds other women showing interest in him, he shouldn't think it's because he's become more attractive. Let the husband know that when a snake holds his gaze at a frog, it is not because the frog is handsome or pretty, the snake is just being a snake and frogs are what they eat. It's just a distraction to ruin his family. I asked a young wife who was spying on her husband to gather evidence of cheating: while she was doing that, who was looking after her kids? When she got back, would her kids still be the same?\n\nThink about the hen and her chicks. As long as she's alert, no one can steal her chicks. But if she gets distracted, what then?\n\n",

Wouldn't it be cool to know how angels live in heaven, how they show up on Earth, or how to make them do stuff for you? What about talking to your dead mom? This curiosity makes some people join cults to learn secret things and try to get an edge over others.\n\nBut here's the catch: the leader of these cults is in chains, and the same thing happens to anyone who climbs the ranks. Knowledge without wisdom can mess you up.\n\nIn Revelation 2:24, it says:\n\n> 24 \u201cBut the rest of you in Thyatira have not followed this evil teaching; you have not learned what the others call \u2018the deep secrets of Satan.\u2019 I say to you that I will not put any other burden on you.\n\nOccult books never use the real names of demons because of Christ. Instead, they use names from the Bible or call them saints. People who read these books often end up messed up. Let God's spirit help you decide what to read and what to avoid.\n\nRemember the Garden of Eden? The devil tricked Adam and Eve with knowledge: Genesis 3:11\n\n> And he said, \u201cWho told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?\u201d\n\nMovies often make witchcraft look cool, but it only leads to destruction.\n\nThe devil is really good at taking the truth and twisting it to lead you astray.\n\n",

Many people thought Peter was just being Peter, but Jesus knows better and rebukes someone else. Check out Matthew 16:21-23:\n\n> 21 From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. 22 Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. \u201cNever, Lord!\u201d he said. \u201cThis shall never happen to you!\u201d 23 Jesus turned and said to Peter, \u201cGet behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.\u201d\n\nSatan can pretend to be humans and use them to trick others. You might think it\u2019s your friend, teacher, or even your parent talking to you, but it could be the devil or one of his demons speaking through them.\n\nFor example, if a friend suggests you try drugs, or someone tells you you're too uptight and should loosen up, it might be the devil using them. Satan even tried to use Peter, one of Jesus' closest friends, but Jesus saw through it and spoke to Satan, not Peter. Imagine how tricky it was for people before Jesus came and revealed these deceptions.\n\n1 John 4:1-3 helps you figure out if someone is speaking by God's spirit or an evil spirit:\n\n> 4 My dear friends, do not believe all who claim to have the Spirit, but test them to find out if the spirit they have comes from God. For many false prophets have gone out everywhere. 2 This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit: anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God. 3 But anyone who denies this about Jesus does not have the Spirit from God. The spirit that he has is from the Enemy of Christ; you heard that it would come, and now it is here in the world already.\n\nImagine if the leader of your country was being tricked by Satan, which has happened before. Look at 1 Corinthians 2:8:\n\n> None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\n\nEvil spirits can fill your mind with thoughts that seem like your own, and they can make you think God is talking to you when it\u2019s really them.\n",

What makes you open your mouth to speak a word?\n4. What are *motives, intents, meanings, motivating thoughts*?\n5. Does God know your *motives, intents, meanings, motivating thoughts*?\n6. Does God need you to speak a word before he knows your *motives, intents, meanings, motivating thoughts*?\n7. If you knew what a person *meant* before they spoke, will you wait to hear what they had to say before finding out their *meaning*?\n8. Do words have value in prayer?\n9. If you know that your friend *intends* to give you a gift, do you go ahead and take the gift?\n10. If words are valueless in prayer, why does God require you to speak when you pray, anyway?\n11. If words are valueless in prayer, should you use a lot of words when you pray, in order to try to impress God? \n12. Does God answer your prayers based on your *motives, intents,  meanings, motivating thoughts*, or the words that you speak when you pray?\n13. Should you be sincere when you pray (say what you *mean*), or say one thing when you *mean* another?\n14. In what ways do humans say one thing when they *mean* another?\n15. In what ways can you be sincere in your prayers?\n16. When you plant crops close to a river and you want the river to flow to the crops, what will you have to do?\n17. Can you move the crops to the river, the river to the crops, or dig trenches from the river to the crops so that the river would flow to the crops?\n18. If God was an endless, boundless river, and your body was the land, and your mind, heart, conscience, etc. were the crops, how will you be able to let God, which is the river, flow to the crops, your will, heart, mind, conscience, desires, tongue?\n19. If God was an endless river flowing from within you, and you wanted him to fill all the members of your body(heart, mind, will, conscience, etc.) what will you have to do?\n20. How do you fill your mind with God?\n21. How do you fill your heart with God?\n22. How do you fill your conscience with God?\n23. In Luke 22:42 how did Christ give his will to the Father?\n> Not my will, but yours be done \n24. What kind of things will you wish for when your heart has been filled with God? \n25. How will you think when your mind has been filled with God?\n26. How will you behave the more trenches you dig in yourself for God to fill?\n27. Are you more likely to do the will of God when you are filled with God?\n28. Will you fall into temptations when the members of your body are filled with God?\n29. Are you likely to make the right choices when the members of your body have been given to God and filled with God?\n30. When you have a difficult decision to make, do you ask God to fill you so that you can make the right choice, or do you worry?\n31. When you are faced with challenges should you ask God to take away the challenge, or fill yourself with God through prayer, so that you will be able to go through it?\n32. When things are not going your way, should you complain to God, or fill yourself with God through prayer, so that you will know the right thing to do?\n33. Is prayer for filling ourselves with God in order to do the will of God, or prayer is for instructing God, and telling God what to do?\n34. Did God create Man before creating his food, or his food before creating Man?\n35. Did God wait for the Man to pray for food before providing him with his food?\n36. Has God provided all your needs?\n37. Should you use prayer to ask God for *things* (money, clothes, shoes, etc.)?\n38. Who is the first person you must talk to when you wake up in the morning?\n39. Fill yourself with God through prayer.\n",

Is the new flame different from the original flame?\n4. Is the new flame, less powerful than the original flame?\n5. Why is God like a flame?\n6. Is God able to divide himself without losing himself?\n7. Who is the original flame?\n8. What does the Father do, personally?\n9. If the Father gives personality to all individuals, is he a personality himself, or a super personality?  \n10. Should you say that you have a certain personality because of the day that you were born? \n11. Who is the second flame to come out of the original flame?\n12. Why is the Son also called the Word? John 1:1\n>In the beginning, was the Word,  and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.\n13. Is the Word a person or a book?\n14. Has anybody seen the Father before?\n15. If you wish to know what the Father has to say, whom do you go to?\n16. How did humans know the words of the Father in Matthew 5:48?\n>Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n17. What else does the Son do apart from being the Word? John 1:1-3\n> In the beginning was the Word,  and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.  2 He was with God in the beginning.  3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. \n18. Who created our universe and everything in it including humans?\n19. In Genesis 1:3, who said let there be light, and who created the light?\n> And God said, \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was light.\n20. Who is the third flame to come out of the original flame?\n21. What does the Spirit do, personally? John 6:63\n> It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.\n22. What makes the three Gods, Father, Son, and Spirit a Trinity?\n23. How do the three Gods, Father, Son, and Spirit agree as one?\n24. In Genesis 1:26, who is God, and who is \"us?\"\n> Then God said, \u201cLet us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky,  over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\u201d\n25. Will you exist if all but one member of the Trinity does not agree?\n26. What does it mean to be *just*?\n27. Can the Father be *just* without the agreement of the Trinity?\n28. Is every new flame that comes out of the Father also God?\n29. Which other flames came out of the Father, who is also God but not the Father?\n30. In Isaiah 11:2, who are the seven Spirits of God?\n> 1. The Spirit of Wisdom  \n> 2. The Spirit of the Lord  \n> 3. The Spirit of Understanding\n> 4. The Spirit of Counsel  \n> 5. The Spirit of Power  \n> 6. The Spirit of Knowledge\n> 7. The Spirit of the Fear of the Lord\n31. Where does the spirit of God in man come from?\n32. Does God dwell in Time, Eternity, or both?\n33. Is Eternity a long time?\n34. What is the reason for your answer?\n35. Is Eternity and Time the same thing or completely different?\n36. How do things happen in Time?\n37. How do things happen in Eternity?\n38. What is the Eternal life? John 17:3\n> 3 Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\n39. Can you live the Eternal life when you do not know God?\n40. Can you live the Eternal life when you do not think like God?\n41. Can you live the Eternal life when you do not speak like God?\n42. Can you live the Eternal life when you do not act like God?\n43. When do you say that a person has Eternal life?\n44. Do you dwell in Time or Eternity?\n45. Is everything created?\n46. Is God created or uncreated?\n47. Who created existence?\n48. Does God *exist*, or God *Is*, and it is through him that other beings are brought into existence? Exodus 3:14\n> God said to Moses, \u201cI AM WHO I AM\u201d; and He said, \u201cYou shall say this to the Israelites, 'I AM has sent me to you. ' \u201d\n",

In John 3:16, who is God, and who is his one and only son?\n>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\n2. Who created all things? John 1:1-3\n> In the beginning was the Word,  and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God.  2 He was with God in the beginning.  3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.\n3. Did Christ exist after he was born in this world, or has he always been, and it is through him that all humans exist? John 8:48-58\n> 48 The Jews answered him, \u201cAren\u2019t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan  and demon-possessed?\u201d\n> \n> 49 \u201cI am not possessed by a demon,\u201d  said Jesus,  \u201cbut I honor my Father and you dishonor me.  50 I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.  51 Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.\u201d\n> \n> 52 At this they exclaimed, \u201cNow we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death.  53 Are you greater than our father Abraham?  He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?\u201d\n> \n> 54 Jesus replied,  \u201cIf I glorify myself,  my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.  55 Though you do not know him,  I know him.  If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.  56 Your father Abraham  rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.\u201d\n> \n> 57 \u201cYou are not yet fifty years old,\u201d they said to him, \u201cand you have seen Abraham!\u201d\n> \n> 58 \u201cVery truly I tell you,\u201d  Jesus answered,  \u201cbefore Abraham was born,  I am!\u201d\n4. Is Christ God?\n5. Did Christ come into the world as a man, doing God's will, or as God? John 14:10\n> 10 Don\u2019t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.\n6. Did Christ go through life's various stages and challenges as a man or as God?\n7. From his childhood, did Christ know that he was God? Mark 10:17-18\n> 17 As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. \u201cGood teacher,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d\n> \n> 18 \u201cWhy do you call me good?\u201d  Jesus answered.  \u201cNo one is good\u2014except God alone.\n8. Did Christ learn about the Father, and start his fellowship with the Father the same way as every other human would have, by going to Sunday school, studying the scriptures, and doing the will of the Father, until he and the Father had become one? Luke 2:46, Luke 2:52\n>Luke 2:46\n>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the  teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.\n>\n>Luke 2:52\n> \u201cAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.\u201d\n9. Who confirmed Jesus Christ as a true child of God, when his will and the Father's will had become one, after doing God's will for a long time? Matthew 3:13-17\n> 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. 14 But John tried to deter him, saying, \u201cI need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?\u201d\n> \n> 15 Jesus replied,  \u201cLet it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d  Then John consented.\n> \n> 16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened,  and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.  17 And a voice from heaven  said,\n> \u201cThis is my Son,  whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\u201d\n10. Will you also receive a confirmation from the Father in your spirit when your will and the Father's will have become one after doing his will for some time? \n11. In John 10:10, who is the thief, what does he want, and what does Christ want for every human?\n>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\n12. Who gave you life?\n13. If Satan can make you turn against your Father in Heaven has he stolen you from him?\n14. In what ways does Satan try to destroy the children of God?\n15. Will Satan try to kill you if all his attempts fail?\n16. In what way did Christ expect people to know who he was? John 10:24-25\n> 24 The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, \u201cHow long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.\u201d\n> \n> 25 Jesus answered,  \u201cI did tell you,  but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father\u2019s name testify about me,\n17. Are you *something* because of what you do every day, or what you say that you are?\n18. How is Christ the way to the Father? John 14:4-6\n> 4 You know the way to the place where I am going.\u201d 5 Thomas  said to him, \u201cLord, we don\u2019t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?\u201d\n> \n> 6 Jesus answered,  \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life.  No one comes to  the Father except through me.\n19. What examples did Christ *do* and *teach* humans as the way to become like Christ? (Read the Gospels)\n20. Can you believe in Christ without practicing his teachings?\n21. Which examples of Christ are you following now?\n22. Was Christ willing to forgive the people who had tortured him and hanged him on the cross to die? Luke 23:34\n> 34 Jesus said, \u201cFather,  forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.\n23. Which character and mind will be formed in you when you believe in Christ by acting on his word?\n24. How can Christ be formed in you?\n25. When you blow air into a balloon and place it on a bucket of water will it float or will it sink? \n26. When you press the balloon to the bottom of the bucket and you leave it what will happen to the balloon?\n27. In John 11:20-26, how is Christ the resurrection and the life? \n> 20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.\n> \n> 21 \u201cLord,\u201d Martha said to Jesus, \u201cif you had been here, my brother would not have died.  22 But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.\u201d\n> \n> 23 Jesus said to her,  \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d\n> \n> 24 Martha answered, \u201cI know he will rise again in the resurrection  at the last day.\u201d\n> \n> 25 Jesus said to her,  \u201cI am the resurrection and the life.  The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;  26 and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.  Do you believe this?\u201d\n28. When you do not have the character and mind of Christ can you be resurrected?\n29. In what way is a person who has become like Christ, like a balloon?\n30. Through Christ, should there be other Christs?\n31. Does Christ's resurrection teach humans that when a man has formed Christ in them, they are *capable* of being resurrected, and that resurrection is *possible*?\n32. Did Christ wish to go through the suffering on the cross, or he went through it because it was the Father's will? \n> \u201cFather, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.\u201d\n33. Are you also willing to do the Father's will even when it does not make you happy?\n34. Did the people of his day find it easy to accept the teachings of Christ, including the disciples?\n35. Did the disciples believe that Christ would resurrect after his death on the cross? John 20:24-29\n> 24 Now Thomas  (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.  25 So the other disciples told him, \u201cWe have seen the Lord!\u201d\n> \n> But he said to them, \u201cUnless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side,  I will not believe.\u201d\n> \n> 26 A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said,  \u201cPeace  be with you!\u201d  27 Then he said to Thomas, \u201cPut your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\u201d\n> \n> 28 Thomas said to him, \u201cMy Lord and my God!\u201d\n> \n> 29 Then Jesus told him,  \u201cBecause you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\u201d\n36. Did Christ know that for the people to truly believe him he had to give them a sign? Matthew 12:38-39\n> 38 Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, \u201cTeacher, we want to see a sign  from you.\u201d\n> \n> 39 He answered,  \u201cA wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.\n37. What sign would he give them to make them believe?\n38. If Christ had not died in public, would his resurrection have meant anything to the people of his day? \n39. If Christ had not resurrected from the dead, would his message have taken deeper roots in the hearts of the people, making them believe that all that he said was true? John 11:25\n> Jesus said to her, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;\n40. When the people believed him after his resurrection were they willing to spread the message to other towns and even die while doing so?\n41. In what way did the Father use Christ's public humiliation and death on the cross to make Christ's message take deeper roots in the hearts of men after his resurrection, to the point where they were willing to die for it?\n42. Did the Father use what the Devil had planned for evil, for good, by letting Christ go through public humiliation and death, or did the Father plan to have Christ crucified all along?\n43. Can humans enter God's kingdom and be saved from darkness if only they will believe in Christ's teachings?\n44. If the price to pay for Christ's message to be accepted by the people was death by the cross, and later resurrection, was Christ willing to do what it would take by paying the price?\n45. Did the Father pay the price by giving his very best, his only begotten son?\n46. Does the Father allowing Christ to go through so much suffering teach humans how far he is willing to go to rescue even the most stubborn human from darkness?\n47. Does Christ humbling himself even unto death, teach humans how far we must be willing to go to do God's will?\n48. Can the problem of humans living in darkness, and dying because of it, be solved?\n49. Is there a price to pay to solve it?\n50. Are you willing to pay the price?\n51. Did Christ come to replace the laws of the prophets, or improve upon them and give them their full meaning? Matthew 5:33-37, Matthew 5:38-39, Matthew 19:8-11, Matthew 5:43-46, Matthew 5:27-28, Matthew 5:17\n>Matthew 5:33-37\n>33 \u201cAgain, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, \u2018Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.\u2019 34 But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God\u2019s throne; 35 or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 36 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. 37 All you need to say is simply \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.\n>\n>Matthew 5:38-39 \n>38 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.\u2019 39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.\n>\n>Matthew 19:8-11\n>8 Jesus replied,  \u201cMoses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.  9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.\u201d\n>\n>Matthew 5:43-46\n>43 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?\n>\n>Matthew 5:27-28\n>27 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\n>\n>Matthew 5:17\n>Don't suppose I came to do away with the Law and the Prophets. I did not come to do away with them, but to give them their full meaning.\n52. Does following Christ's teachings mean that you no longer have to obey the law? Matthew 5:19\n> Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\n53. Can you become perfect by following laws alone?\n54. What is the reason for your answer?\n55. Do the laws of God cover every aspect of human living and behavior?\n56. Can you become perfect by following the laws of God and Christ who by taking on human nature also understands you and knows how to deal with the things that stop you from becoming perfect? Matthew 5:20\n> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.\n57. Did Christ come to start a new religion named after him, or to establish the kingdom of God on earth?\n58. Where is the kingdom of God on earth? Luke 17:20-21\n> 20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:\n> \n> 21 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\n59. How do you enter God's kingdom?\n60. Can you enter God's kingdom without submitting yourself to God, daily? Luke 22:42\n>\u201cFather, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.\u201d\n61. Did the Jews accept or reject Christ's teachings? John 10:20-21\n> 20 Many of them said, \u201cHe is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?\u201d\n> \n> 21 But others said, \u201cThese are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon.  Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\u201d\n62. What would happen to Jerusalem shortly after Christ had been taken up into Heaven? Luke 19:41-44\n>41 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it  42 and said,  \u201cIf you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace\u2014but now it is hidden from your eyes.  43 The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.  44 They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls.  They will not leave one stone on another,  because you did not recognize the time of God\u2019s coming  to you.\u201d\n63. When Christ was about to be crucified, and the women wept for him, why did he say to them \"Weep for yourselves\"? Luke 23:27-28\n>27 A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.  28 Jesus turned and said to them,  \u201cDaughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.\n64. What happened to Jerusalem shortly after Christ had been taken up into Heaven?\n65. If the Jews had accepted Christ's message would the Romans have destroyed their cities and temples and killed so many of them?\n66. If all men accept God as their Father, will they treat each other as brothers and sisters, or as foreigners and enemies? John 4:7-9\n> 7 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her,  \u201cWill you give me a drink?\u201d  8 (His disciples had gone into the town  to buy food.)\n> \n> 9 The Samaritan woman said to him, \u201cYou are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?\u201d (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)\n67. If all men accept each other as brothers and sisters, will they continue to fight each other or allow the peace of God to reign on earth?\n68. What is a parable?\n69. What is the parable of the tenants? Luke 20:9-19\n> 9 He went on to tell the people this parable:  \u201cA man planted a vineyard,  rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time. \n> 10 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.  11 He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.  12 He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.\n> \n> 13 \u201cThen the owner of the vineyard said, \u2018What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love;  perhaps they will respect him.\u2019\n> \n> 14 \u201cBut when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. \u2018This is the heir,\u2019 they said. \u2018Let\u2019s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.\u2019  15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\n> \n> \u201cWhat then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?  16 He will come and kill those tenants  and give the vineyard to others.\u201d\n> \n> When the people heard this, they said, \u201cGod forbid!\u201d\n> \n> 17 Jesus looked directly at them and asked,  \u201cThen what is the meaning of that which is written:\n> \n> \u201c\u2018The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\u2019?\n> \n> 18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.\u201d\n> \n> 19 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.\n70. What does the vineyard represent in the parable?\n71. Who is the owner of the vineyard? \n72. Who are the tenants? Matthew 23:29-35\n> 29 \u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.  30 And you say, \u2018If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.\u2019  31 So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.  32 Go ahead, then, and complete  what your ancestors started!\n> \n> 33 \u201cYou snakes! You brood of vipers!  How will you escape being condemned to hell?  34 Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify;  others you will flog in your synagogues  and pursue from town to town.  35 And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel  to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah,  whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.\n73. In what ways did the tenants beat and treat the servants shamefully?\n74. What is the fruit of the vineyard?\n75. Who were the servants sent to the vineyard to collect the fruits of the vineyard?\n76. Who was the son sent to collect the vineyard's fruits?\n77. Did Christ come into the world to be humiliated and killed or to draw men into the Father's kingdom by his teachings and lifestyle?\n78. Was Christ sacrificed or betrayed and murdered? Acts 7:52-53\n>52 Was there any prophet that your ancestors did not persecute? They killed God's messengers, who long ago announced the coming of his righteous Servant. And now you have betrayed and murdered him. 53 You are the ones who received God's law, that was handed down by angels\u2014yet you have not obeyed it!\u201d\n79. What is the harvest, and who are the laborers? Matthew 9:35-38\n>35 And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction.  36 When he saw the crowds,  he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless,  like sheep without a shepherd.  37 Then he said to his disciples, \u201cThe harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;  38 therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to  send out laborers into his harvest.\u201d\n80. Was Christ able to forgive sins before he was crucified? Matthew 9:2-7\n> 2 Some men brought to him a paralyzed man,  lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith,  he said to the man,  \u201cTake heart,  son; your sins are forgiven.\u201d\n> \n> 3 At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, \u201cThis fellow is blaspheming!\u201d\n> \n> 4 Knowing their thoughts,  Jesus said,  \u201cWhy do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?  5 Which is easier: to say, \u2018Your sins are forgiven,\u2019 or to say, \u2018Get up and walk\u2019?  6 But I want you to know that the Son of Man  has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d  So he said to the paralyzed man,  \u201cGet up, take your mat and go home.\u201d  7 Then the man got up and went home.\n81. Did humans have to spill the blood of Christ to be forgiven of their sins?\n82. In what way does Christ take away the sin of the world? John 1:29\n> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \u201cLook, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\n83. In what way did Christ fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah in Isaiah 53:4? Matthew 8:14-17\n> 14 When Jesus came into Peter\u2019s house, he saw Peter\u2019s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.  15 He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.\n> \n> 16 When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. 17 This was to fulfill  what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:\n> \n> \u201cHe took up our infirmities   and bore our diseases.\u201d\n\n84. What is the story of the woman caught in adultery? John 8:1-11\n> 8 1 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.\n> \n> 2 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. 3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group 4 and said to Jesus, \u201cTeacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\u201d 6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.\n> \n> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \u201cLet any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the\n> ground.\n> \n> 9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, \u201cWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u201d\n> \n> 11 \u201cNo one, sir,\u201d she said.\n> \n> \u201cThen neither do I condemn you,\u201d Jesus declared. \u201cGo now and leave your life of sin.\u201d\n85. Was it possible for humans to stop sinning before Christ was crucified? John 8:11\n86. How do you stop sinning?\n87. Was Christ able to teach all that he wanted to before he was taken up into Heaven? John 16:12\n>\u201cI have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.\n88. How did Christ know that the people could not bear all that he had to say to them? John 3:1-12\n> 3 Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus  who was a member of the Jewish ruling council.  2 He came to Jesus at night and said, \u201cRabbi,  we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs  you are doing if God were not with him.\u201d\n> \n> 3 Jesus replied,  \u201cVery truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.\u201d\n> \n> 4 \u201cHow can someone be born when they are old?\u201d Nicodemus asked. \u201cSurely they cannot enter a second time into their mother\u2019s womb to be\n> born!\u201d\n> \n> 5 Jesus answered,  \u201cVery truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.  6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.  7 You should not be surprised at my saying, \u2018You must be born again.\u2019  8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\u201d\n> \n> 9 \u201cHow can this be?\u201d  Nicodemus asked.\n> \n> 10 \u201cYou are Israel\u2019s teacher,\u201d  said Jesus,  \u201cand do you not understand these things?  11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know,  and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.  12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?\n89. Who will continue his work after he has been taken up into Heaven? John 16:13\n>But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.\n90. While on earth why did Christ call himself the Son of Man? Matthew 8:20\n> \u201cAnd Jesus said to him, \u2018Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\u2019\u201d\n91. Is human experience already in God from the beginning, or is human experience obtained by living like a human?\n92. Did Christ rule over our universe after creating it, or did he wait until he had first put on human nature, thereby becoming both Son of God and Son of Man? Matthew 28:16-18\n> 16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.  17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.  18 Then Jesus came to them and said,  \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\n93. Who gave Christ all authority?\n94. What did Christ have after his resurrection, that he did not have before his crucifixion? Matthew 28:18\n> 18 Then Jesus came to them and said,  \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\n95. What could go wrong if Christ ruled our universe after creating it, without first putting on human nature?\n96. What can go wrong when you try advancing a child when you have never been a child before?\n97. In Matthew 23:11 why does the Father (through Christ) say\n> The greatest among you must be a servant.\n98. Would Christ use his authority over Man, fairly, if he had not first obtained a human experience, and known what it was like to be human? Luke 23:34, Luke 5:21-22\n> Luke 23:34\n> Jesus said, \u201cFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.\n> \n> Luke 5:21-22\n> 21 The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, \u201cWho is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?\u201d\n>22 Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked,  \u201cWhy are you thinking these things in your hearts?\n99. If God himself goes through the proper way to assume authority, should humans also learn to do things the proper way?\n100. Did Christ live his life on earth by seeking the will of the Father and doing it? John 6:38\n> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.\n101. Should humans also spend their lives seeking the will of God and doing it?\n102. Was Christ able to fulfill the law? Matthew 5:17\n>\u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\n103. Is Christ able to help you fulfill the law as well?\n",

John 14:16-17\n> 16 I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, who will stay with you forever. 17 He is the Spirit, who reveals the truth about God. The world cannot receive him, because it cannot see him or know him. But you know him, because he remains with you and is in you.\n2. Which kind of people cannot receive the Holy Spirit?\n3. Why can't the people of the world receive the Holy Spirit?\n4. Will the Holy Spirit ever leave you after you have received him?\n5. In what ways will the Holy Spirit help you? John 16:13, John 14:26, John 16:13, Acts 1:8\n> John 16:13\n> But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.\n>\n>John 14:26\n>26 The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and make you remember all that I have told you.\n>\n>John 16:13\n>13 When, however, the Spirit comes, who reveals the truth about God, he will lead you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of what he hears and will tell you of things to come.\n>\n>Acts 1:8\n>8 But when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will be filled with power, and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, in all of Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\u201d\n6.  Is the Holy Spirit a person, a thing, or a dove?\n7. If Christ did not ascend into Heaven, would the Holy Spirit be sent to earth? John 16:7\n> 7 But I am telling you the truth: it is better for you that I go away, because if I do not go, the Helper will not come to you. But if I do go away, then I will send him to you.\n8. Can you live the life of Christ without the Holy Spirit?\n9. Will God give you the Holy Spirit if you ask? Luke 11:9-13\n> 9 \u201cSo I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you;  seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.  10 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.\n>11 \u201cWhich of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?  12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?  13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\u201d\n10. Do you wish to receive the Holy Spirit?\n11. In Acts 2:1-4, what happened to the disciples on the day of Pentecost?\n> 2 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.  2 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.  3 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.  4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.\n12. Has the Holy Spirit been sent down on earth?\n13. When was the Holy Spirit sent down on earth?\n14. When the disciples received the Holy Spirit what was the first thing they did? \n15. When you receive the Holy Spirit will there be a visible sign?\n16. When you receive the Holy Spirit will you also be able to speak in other tongues?\n17. Does speaking in tongues align your will with the will of God?\n18. Pray and thank God for the gift of the Holy Spirit. \n19. Since the Holy Spirit has already been sent down, you only have to ask the Holy Spirit to come and fill you in Jesus' name. After praying, open your mouth and speak whatever language the Spirit enables you to speak.\n20. In what way does John the Baptist baptize? Matthew 3:11\n> 11 I baptize you with water to show that you have repented, but the one who will come after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. He is much greater than I am; and I am not good enough even to carry his sandals.\n21. In what way does Jesus Christ baptize?\n22. Which baptism is greater?\n23. Speak in tongues as often as you can and follow the leadings of the Spirit\n",

What are some uses of wheat?\n5. Have you seen a weed before?\n6. Pull out a weed from around you and show it to your instructor.\n7. Can you cook a weed and eat it?\n8. When a weed grows around a tomato plant, will the tomato grow properly and be colorful?\n9. What is the reason for your answer?\n10. What do we do with weeds?\n11. When a weed grows around a plant that you intend to eat, what do you do with it?\n12. In Matthew 13:24-30, what is the parable of the Wheat and the Weeds?\n13. If you plant a good seed, can it grow into a bad tree?\n14. Can a tomato grow into a banana tree?\n15. From the parable, how did the man know that an enemy had planted weeds in his field?\n16. In verse 29, why did the man not want the servants to remove the weeds?\n17. Do the weeds and the wheat look very much alike?\n18. Why will the servants accidentally pull out the wheat?\n19. From this parable, who is the man who planted the good seeds?\n20. What are the good seeds?\n21. Who are the servants?\n22. Who is the enemy who planted the weeds?\n23. What are the weeds?\n24. What does the field represent?\n25. In verse 30, what will happen to the weeds?\n26. In Matthew 13:37-43, how does Christ explain the parable of the wheat and the weeds?\n27. Is a human being a seed?\n28. What is the reason for your answer?\n29. From the explanation above, who is the man who planted the good seeds?\n30. What are the good seeds?\n31. Who are the servants?\n32. Who is the enemy who planted the weeds?\n33. What are the weeds?\n34. What does the field represent?\n35. Are all humans put here by Christ?\n36. Who are the two kinds of humans in this world?\n37. Do the children of the Devil and the children of God look alike at the beginning when they are born?\n38. What are some things that the child of the Devil will do to expose who they are?\n39. Did all the teachings of Christ stop Judas Iscariot from betraying him?\n40. Can the seeds of the enemy receive the Holy Spirit? John 14:16-17\n> 16 I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, who will stay with you forever. 17 He is the Spirit, who reveals the truth about God. The world cannot receive him, because it cannot see him or know him. But you know him, because he remains with you and is in you.\n41. What are the fruits of the seeds of God, when they are fed with the word of God?\n42. In the end, what will happen to every human who was not put here by Christ?\n43. What will the children of the Devil attempt to do to the seeds that were put here by Christ?\n44. Is life on earth going to be easy for the children of God, as long as the children of the Devil remain on earth?\n45. Does being a child of God mean that you automatically accept God as your father?\n46. Pray to God, accept him as your father, and ask him to take you as his child and make you what he wishes to make of you.\n47. In Matthew 10:34, what does a sword do?\n>34 \u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\n",

In Matthew 13:31-32, what is the parable of the mustard seed?\n> 31 Jesus told them another parable: \u201cThe Kingdom of heaven is like this. A man takes a mustard seed and sows it in his field. 32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows up, it is the biggest of all plants. It becomes a tree, so that birds come and make their nests in its branches.\u201d\n3. What is the meaning of the parable? \n4. When the word of God is taught to the child of the kingdom who appears little or insignificant, and they practice it, are they able to grow up to become mighty like the mustard seed, and do far better than the seeds of the enemy who may appear bigger and more intelligent in the beginning? \n5. Can the children of the devil be so transformed by the word of God that they grow to become mighty like the mustard seed?\n6. When teaching the word of God, should you look down on those who are little, can barely speak up, and struggle to understand what you are teaching?\n7. What is the meaning of Matthew 13:33?\n> 33 Jesus told them still another parable: \u201cThe Kingdom of heaven is like this. A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour until the whole batch of dough rises.\u201d\n8. What is the flour?\n9. What does the yeast represent?\n10. If you wish to grow as a child of God, what do you have to do?\n11. In Matthew 13:34-35, how long have these things been kept secret from mankind?\n> 34 Jesus used parables to tell all these things to the crowds; he would not say a thing to them without using a parable. 35 He did this to make come true what the prophet had said,\n\u201cI will use parables when I speak to them;  \nI will tell them things unknown since the creation of the world.\u201d\n12. In Matthew 13:47-50, what is the parable of the fishing net?\n> 47 \u201cAlso, the Kingdom of heaven is like this. Some fishermen throw their net out in the lake and catch all kinds of fish. 48 When the net is full, they pull it to shore and sit down to divide the fish: the good ones go into the buckets, the worthless ones are thrown away. 49 It will be like this at the end of the age: the angels will go out and gather up the evil people from among the good 50 and will throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will cry and gnash their teeth.\n13. What is the meaning of the parable?\n14. Is Christ looking for all humans or only those who belong in the kingdom?\n15. When you are teaching the word of God, should you be in a hurry to separate the good seeds from the bad seeds, or first gather all the people that you can, teach them, treat them equally, and let them eventually set themselves apart?\n16. In Matthew 18:10, what does it mean to despise a little child who belongs in the kingdom?\n> 10 \u201cSee that you don't despise any of these little ones. Their angels in heaven, I tell you, are always in the presence of my Father in heaven.\n17. Should you treat a little child as if they were nothing because they are little?\n18. What do their angels do before the Father in his presence?\n19. Are their angels able to carry out instructions from the Father on their behalf?\n20. In Matthew 18:12-14, what is the parable of the lost sheep?\n> 12 \u201cWhat do you think a man does who has one hundred sheep and one of them gets lost? He will leave the other ninety-nine grazing on the hillside and go and look for the lost sheep. 13 When he finds it, I tell you, he feels far happier over this one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost. 14 In just the same way your Father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to be lost.\n21. Does the shepherd go looking for a sheep that did not originally belong to them?\n22. Did the children of God belong to the Father from the beginning?\n23. Does the Father treat his children as numbers, or as only begotten?\n24. What does it mean to be an only-begotten child, when you have many siblings?\n25. When the Father loses you to the lies and deceit of the Devil, will he continue to be happy because he has many other children, or he will be sad and do whatever he can to get you back?\n26. Does the Father love each of his children as if they were his only child?\n\n\n",

John 10:27-28\n>27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:\n28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.\n2. When do you say that you have **faith**?\n3. Can you say you have faith when God has not spoken to you?\n4. When you have faith will you doubt it?\n5. When you are not sure if you heard from God, is it faith?\n6. Is faith a feeling?\n7. Will God tell you to do something big when you have not done the little thing he has asked you to do?\n8.

If the faith that you have received is from a book that you have read, is it living faith?\n15. If the faith you have is a word that you have received from God concerning a specific situation, is it a living faith?\n16. Give examples of living faith\n17. When do you say that you **believe** something?\n18. When you receive faith and act on it, do you believe?\n19. When you receive faith, and you do not act on it, do you believe?\n20. Do you believe by your words or by your actions?\n21. If you say that you believe, yet do not act on it, do you believe?\n22. If you say that you do not believe, yet act on it, did you believe?\n23. In Matthew 14:22-33, what is the story?\n24. From the passage, where do you find faith?\n25. Where do you find belief?\n26. What would have happened if Peter tried walking on the water without first receiving a word from Christ?\n27. If you believe in the word God has spoken to you, will anything be impossible to you? Matthew 17:20\n> He replied, \u201cBecause you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, \u2018Move from here to there,\u2019 and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d\n28. In Matthew 19:16-22 what is the story of Jesus and the Rich Young Ruler?\n> 16 Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, \u201cTeacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?\u201d\n> \n> 17 \u201cWhy do you ask me about what is good?\u201d  Jesus replied.  \u201cThere is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.\u201d\n> \n> 18 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d he inquired.\n> \n> Jesus replied,  \u201c\u2018You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony,  19 honor your father and mother,\u2019 and \u2018love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019\u201d\n> \n> 20 \u201cAll these I have kept,\u201d the young man said. \u201cWhat do I still lack?\u201d\n> \n> 21 Jesus answered,  \u201cIf you want to be perfect,  go, sell your possessions and give to the poor,  and you will have treasure in heaven.  Then come, follow me.\u201d\n> \n> 22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.\n29. From the passage, where do you find faith?\n30.

In verses 39-40, did Martha believe?\n38. When did they believe?\n39. Can you believe in God, and not do what God tells you to do?\n40. How do you believe in John 3:16?\n> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\n41. Is there greatness in every man?\n42. Why is there greatness in every man?\n43. Why are some people great, and others are not? \n44. Quiet Time - Each morning you wake up earlier than you usually do, and do a few things:\n\t-  Sing a worship song to God. Singing worship songs has a way of transforming you from the inside, making you spiritually sensitive, and also allowing you to feel the presence of God in you.\n\t-  You say a prayer\n\t-  Read a portion of scripture. You can start with the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) before saying Proverbs, Psalms, and the others.\n\t-  Meditate on what you have read and think about ways in which you can apply it. For instance, if Christ said that we shall be judged by every single word that we speak, I will start by repenting from every foul word I have ever spoken and be determined to speak only good words going forward.\n\t- God will begin to speak with you. Do as he says.\n\n",

Singing worship songs has a way of transforming you from the inside, making you spiritually sensitive, and also allowing you to feel the presence of God in you.\n-  You say a prayer\n-  Read a portion of scripture. You can start with the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) before saying Proverbs, Psalms, and the others.\n-  Meditate on what you have read and think about ways in which you can apply it. For instance, if Christ said that we shall be judged by every single word that we speak, I will start by repenting from every foul word I have ever spoken and be determined to speak only good words going forward.\n- God will begin to speak with you. Do as he says.\n"

Deuteronomy 8:3, Matthew 4:1-4\n>Deuteronomy 8:3\n>3 So He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every _word_ that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord.\n>\n> Matthew 4:1-4\n> 4 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.  2 After fasting forty days and forty nights,  he was hungry.  3 The tempter  came to him and said, \u201cIf you are the Son of God,  tell these stones to become bread.\u201d\n>4 Jesus answered,  \u201cIt is written: \u2018Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.\u2019\u201d\n10. In Daniel 10:1-12, what is the story?\n11. In Daniel 10:12, how did Daniel humble himself?\n> 12 Then he said, \u201cDaniel, don't be afraid. God has heard your prayers ever since the first day you decided to humble yourself in order to gain understanding. I have come in answer to your prayer.\n12. When fasting should we live by every word that comes from the mouth of God?\n13. In Isaiah 58:6, how are you oppressing other people by holding them in chains?\n> 6 \u201cThe kind of fasting I want is this: Remove the chains of oppression and the yoke of injustice, and let the oppressed go free.\n14. Before you begin a fast should you forgive every person who has offended you and is being held a prisoner in your heart?\n15. When should you begin a fast?\n16. Should you feel hungry during a fast? \n17. When should you end a fast? Matthew 4:2\n> After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.\n18. Should you end your fast when you start feeling hungry?\n19. Begin a fast according to a time of your choosing\n20. Do you realize now that you can live on God's word alone?\n",

One day, your friend offends you and makes you very angry. You can only imagine what you will say or do to them when you meet them. Now you have two choices, the friendship that you had with them, or your anger.  \n2. What will happen if you choose friendship?\n3. Will you be able to continue working with them?\n4. Will you have to avoid them, anytime you meet them?\n5. What will happen if you choose your anger?\n6. Will you be able to continue your friendship with them?\n7. Will you have to avoid them, anytime you meet them?\n8. What look would you have to wear on your face if you had to be in the same place with them?\n9. Will you choose friendship or your anger?\n10. If you chose friendship, what do you have to do in response to the offense?\n11. Should your friend know that they have been forgiven?\n12. What will happen if you forgave them, but did not let them know that they had been forgiven?\n13. How will you let your friend know that you have forgiven them?\n14. Will your friends, parents, or even siblings one day offend you?\n15. Why will they offend you no matter what?\n16. Will you forgive them now, or you will wait until after they have offended you first and said apologized?\n17. Do you **fore**give be**fore** or after you have been offended?\n18. After offending someone, what do you carry on your conscience?\n19. What happens when you sprinkle water over hot oil on a fire?\n20. What causes the guilt in your conscience after you have offended someone?\n21. When you feel guilty, can you carry out your duties like before?\n22. When you are forgiven, what happens to your guilt? Isaiah 6:1-7\n> In the year that  King Uzziah died I  saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple.  2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.  3 And one called to another and said:\n> \n> \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the  Lord  of hosts;   the whole earth is full of his glory!\u201d\n> \n> 4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.  5 And I said: \u201cWoe is me!  For I am lost;  for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the  Lord  of hosts!\u201d\n> \n> 6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.  7 And he  touched my mouth and said: \u201cBehold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.\u201d\n24. If you were starting a journey, and you were told that one mistake on your journey would lead to your death, and you knew that you were not perfect so you were definitely going to make a mistake, would you go on the journey at all?\n25. Can you become perfect at something without a second or multiple attempts?\n26. If you do not forgive the people who offend you, will they get another chance to do better? \n27. How does forgiving others help them to become perfect? \n28. When a person insults you for no reason at all, do you just stay silent and not mind them, or do you show them an act of love by saying \"Thank you!\" with a smile?\n29. Who forgives best, the one who does nothing when they are offended, or the one who responds with kindness?\n30. In Matthew 5:39 what did Jesus mean by turning the other cheek?\n>39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.\n31. Is forgiveness needed in Heaven?\n32. What is the reason for your answer\n33. Is there someone that you have not forgiven?\n34. If yes, then what are you waiting for?\n",

For I am lost;  for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the  Lord  of hosts!\u201d\n> \n> 6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.  7 And he  touched my mouth and said: \u201cBehold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.\u201d"

When a tree starts to grow and become bent, how do you make it grow straight?\n5. Can the stick make the tree straight when it is itself bent?\n6. When the tree is already grown, and it is bent, can you make it straight?\n7. When is the best time to make a tree straight?\n8. When a little tree has been made straight, will it ever get bent again?\n9. Do you know that you are a little bent tree?\n10. When you still insult other people, are you straight?\n11. When you still disobey your teachers, are you straight?\n12. When you hide things from your parents, are you straight?\n13. What can go wrong when you hide things from your parents?\n14. In this story, why did I lose my leg?\n> My mom warned me not to climb trees when I went to school. She said that if she found out I had climbed a tree, I would be punished. But as soon as I got to school, I climbed a tree anyway. The branch broke, and I fell, breaking my leg.

When is the best time for you to become straight?\n18. If you are the little bent tree, who is the stick working to make you straight?\n19. Can the people working to make you straight succeed when they themselves are also not straight?\n20. Write down 4 ways in which God works to make you straight.\n21. Write down 4 ways in which your parents work to make you straight.\n22. Write down 4 ways in which your teachers work to make you straight.\n23. What will happen to you when you do not allow yourself to be made straight by God, your teachers, parents, etc.?\n24. Every weekend, hold the hands of your mother and say a prayer for her.\n25. Repeat the same for your father.\n26. Each morning you wake up earlier than you usually do, and do a few things:\n\t-  Sing a worship song to God. Singing worship songs has a way of transforming you from the inside, making you spiritually sensitive, and also allowing you to feel the presence of God in you.\n\t-  You say a prayer\n\t-  Read a portion of scripture.

Is the parent of the child the one who gives birth to the child or the person who treats the child like their own child?\n5. If the child looks up to you as a parent, and is willing to do all that you instruct them to, are you the parent of the child or the one who gave birth to them?\n6. What are your responsibilities towards the child as their parent?\n7. Should you meet the child's physical needs only, or spiritual as well?\n8. How do you meet the child's physical needs?\n9. How do you meet the child's spiritual needs?\n10. If the child's physical needs are not taken care of, like food, clothing, and shelter can you develop the mind of the child?\n11. If the child is *always* occupied with physical work, can the child have time to do the things that will help them to develop?\n12. How do you protect the child?\n13. Should you protect the body of the child only, or their minds as well?\n14. In what ways can you protect the mind of a child?\n15. Does the child have a mind of their own or do they simply mirror what they see other people do?\n16. How do you help the child to form their mind?\n17. How can you help the child form their mind about strangers, and how to treat them?\n18. How can you help the child form their mind about the purpose of their lives and how to live it?\n19. How can you help the child form their mind about dressing up?\n20. How can you help the child form their mind about God and who God is to them?\n21. When you get tired of talking to the child and answering their questions are you helping them to form their mind?\n22. If you do not help the child to form their mind, will they form their mind elsewhere?\n23. In what ways can the child form their mind elsewhere?\n24. If you are always thinking for the child and making decisions for them, will their mind form properly?\n25. Does the child have a will of their own or they are born having their own will?\n26. In what ways can you help shape the will of a child?\n27. Can you shape the will of a child when you do not allow them to make choices and face the consequences of their choices?\n28. If you are always forcing them to do the right thing are you shaping the will of the child?\n29. Does the child have a character of their own?\n30.

Guess what, he lives in you and hears everything you say. You confess your sins to him and ask for forgiveness. You then surrender yourself to him. Yes, the Christian life begins with acknowledging that God knows what is best for you and totally surrendering your heart, mind, body, and soul to him. Tell him \"Heavenly Father, I give you my heart, I give you my mind, I give you my body and soul in Jesus' name.\" God uses your heart to guide you. Each day that you wake up you must consecrate yourself unto God by surrendering yourself to him. As you continue to follow the leading of his spirit he will begin his work of perfecting you.\n\nYou can later find a church to fellowship with. \n\nYour quiet time with God is also very important in your walk with God. Each morning you wake up earlier than you usually do, and do a few things:\n\n-  Sing a worship song. Singing worship songs has a way of transforming you from the inside, making you spiritually sensitive, and also allowing you to feel the presence of God in you.\n    \n-  You say a prayer\n    \n-  Read a portion of scripture. I recommend that you start with the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) before saying Proverbs, Psalms, and the others.\n    \n-  Meditate on what you have read and think about ways in which you can apply it. For instance, if Christ said that we shall be judged by every single word that we speak, I will start by repenting from every foul word I have ever spoken and be determined to speak only good words from now on.\n- God will begin to speak to you. Do as he says.\n\nGod is not concerned with where you are now or where you have been; only where you wish to be. He knows how to get you to your destination, so don't let your past sins weigh you down.\n\nMatthew 5: 48 is your watch-verse.\n\n",

And in doing so, we can miss the still small voice of God or the Divine speaking to us and guiding us along the path that will bring us true happiness instead of the illusions we mistake for happiness, such as fame, wealth and celebrity status.\n\nSo the next time you feel down and are on your quest for the extraordinary life, turn your head from time to time, and look out for these little miracles to brighten your days.\n\n1.  The beauty of the wild flowers and grasses.  \n    Jesus said that even King Solomon was never dressed so beautifully as these creations. And it costs nothing to see them!\n2.  The spontaneous laughter of a child.\n3.  The hugs of a friend whom you have not met for a long time.\n4.  Cerulean blue skies and waters, almost so clear that you could see past the clouds or the water surface.\n5.  Chocolates and candies.\n6.  A sudden call from the person whom you have been thinking about the whole day.\n7.  How a stranger\u2019s face lights up the moment you spare him or her your best smile.\n8.  The joy of wine or beer with friends.\n9.  The peaceful and tender trust a child places in you as you hug or carry him or her.\n10.  Playing with a child and behaving like a child in the process.\n11.  The call from a friend telling you about a wonderful job you did earlier.\n12.  Compliments from friends and family.\n13.  Unexpected gifts from friends and family.\n14.  The joy you feel when a \u201cprodigal\u201d friend or relative returns to the right path.\n15.  Dancing with a child with full abandon.\n16.  Pranks with friends.\n17.  Quiet moments with the one you love.\n18.  The joy of reading good books.\n19.  Simple yet tasty and delicious food.\n20.  Ticking off in your head the things you are grateful for every day.\n21.  Singing or dancing in the rain.\n22.  Dressing for comfort and not to impress.\n23.  Cracking your head over a good gift for a friend or relative.\n24.  Love with no desire for anything in return.\n25.  Humming simple songs you love.\n26.  Remembering and memorising poetry.\n27.  Meetings that go so well you don\u2019t realise when one hour turns to two, and then to three.\n28.  Knowing there is someone who loves and cherishes you, and that you love and cherish that someone too.\n29.  When you have friends who date back to when you started school or kindergarten\n30.  Making lists like this one, and many more besides.\n\n\u2018The world is so full of a number of things, I\u2019m sure we should all be as happy as kings\u2019 \u2014 Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nDo things like this make you happy?\n\nRemember: Happiness may be just right under our noses in more ways than we think. So here\u2019s to thinking and seeking simple and happy things!\n"

Spilled my own blood, to make certain I was living. Life was a class I\u2019d slept through, and when I woke up, I was clueless and confused. I watched other people to learn their ways, not being formally educated, vulnerable to ridicule.\n\nOutsiders know they\u2019re missing something, but no one tells them what it is. It\u2019s like a joke you don\u2019t get, but everyone is laughing. Laugh or be found stupid, of course you laugh. Maybe We the People don\u2019t want to be laughed at, though most everyone is laughing at us. We don\u2019t want to think for ourselves, so we see what the news has to say, and give them the power to feed us. Most of it\u2019s not nourishing. People enjoy drama and mayhem. Soft news sells nothing, puts people to sleep. I no longer feel guilty for not watching. I don\u2019t go slow to see the car wreck, and am trying hard not to gossip. I\u2019m staying in my own business. Who am I, to poke around in yours?\n\nLife seems much simpler now. Kinder. Honest. Peaceful. I don\u2019t do things to *make* me happy (but if doing them makes me unhappy, why keep doing them?), but make decisions based on merit. If it\u2019s worth doing, if there\u2019s benefit, I do it and I am happy (if I fail to do it well and it seems worth it, I try harder, work longer, get advice and do it better. If I see that I\u2019m not suited, no matter the effort, I turn it over to those more capable. No shame. No judgment). When I leave this life, I want to be translucent. I want to Love so well, so deeply, there simply isn\u2019t another choice.\n"
